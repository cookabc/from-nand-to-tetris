### 2.5 Project
---


&emsp;&emsp;**Objective** Implement all the chips presented in this chapter. The only building blocks that you can use are the chips that you will gradually build and the chips described in the previous chapter.

&emsp;&emsp;**Tips** When your HDL programs invoke chips that you may have built in the previous project, we recommend that you use the built-in versions of these chips instead. This will ensure correctness and speed up the operation of the hardware simulator. There is a simple way to accomplish this convention: Make sure that your project directory includes only the .hdl files that belong to the present project.

&emsp;&emsp;The remaining instructions for this project are identical to those of the project from the previous chapter, except that the last step should be replaced with “Build and simulate all the chips specified in the projects/02 directory.”
