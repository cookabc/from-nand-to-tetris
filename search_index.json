forget; What I see, I remember; What I do, I understand.\n——Confucius, 551-479 BC\n\n\n  Once upon a time, every computer specialist had a gestalt understanding of how computers worked. The overall interactions among hardware, software, compilers, and the operating system were simple and transparent enough to produce a coherent picture of the computer’s operations. As modern computer technologies have become increasingly more complex, this clarity is all but lost: the most fundamental ideas and techniques in computer science—the very essence of the field—are now hidden under many layers of obscure interfaces and proprietary implementations. An inevitable consequence of this complexity has been specialization, leading to computer science curricula of many courses, each covering a single aspect of the field.\n  We wrote this book because we felt that many computer science students are missing the forest for the trees. The typical student is marshaled through a series of courses in programming, theory, and engineering, without pausing to appreciate the beauty of the picture at large. And the picture at large is such that hardware and software systems are tightly interrelated through a hidden web of abstractions, interfaces, and contract-based implementations. Failure to see this intricate enterprise in the flesh leaves many students and professionals with an uneasy feeling that, well, they don’t fully understand what’s going on inside computers.\n  We believe that the best way to understand how computers work is to build one from scratch. With that in mind, we came up with the following concept. Let’s specify a simple but sufficiently powerful computer system, and have the students build its hardware platform and software hierarchy from the ground up, starting with nothing more than elementary logic gates. And while we are at it, let’s do it right. We say this because building a general-purpose computer from first principles is a huge undertaking. Therefore, we identified a unique educational opportunity not only to build the thing, but also to illustrate, in a hands-on fashion, how to effectively plan and manage large-scale hardware and software development projects. In addition, we sought to demonstrate the ability to construct, through recursive ascent and human reasoning, fantastically complex and useful systems from nothing more than a few primitive building blocks.\n"},"chapter01/00-Boolean_Logic.html":{"url":"chapter01/00-Boolean_Logic.html","title":"01. Boolean Logic","keywords":"","body":"Chapter 1: Boolean Logic\n\n  Every digital device—be it a personal computer, a cellular telephone, or a network router—is based on a set of chips designed to store and process information. Although these chips come in different shapes and forms, they are all made from the same building blocks: Elementary logic gates. The gates can be physically implemented in many different materials and fabrication technologies, but their logical behavior is consistent across all computers. In this chapter we start out with one primitive logic gate--Nand--and build all the other logic gates from it. The result is a rather standard set of gates, which will be later used to construct our computer’s processing and storage chips. This will be done in chapters 2 and 3, respectively.\n  All the hardware chapters in the book, beginning with this one, have the same structure. Each chapter focuses on a well-defined task, designed to construct or integrate a certain family of chips. The prerequisite knowledge needed to approach this task is provided in a brief Background section. The next section provides a complete Specification of the chips’ abstractions, namely, the various services that they should deliver, one way or another. Having presented the what, a subsequent Implementation section proposes guidelines and hints about how the chips can be actually implemented. A Perspective section rounds up the chapter with concluding comments about important topics that were left out from the discussion. Each chapter ends with a technical Project section. This section gives step-by-step instructions for actually building the chips on a personal computer, using the hardware simulator supplied with the book.\n  This being the first hardware chapter in the book, the Background section is somewhat lengthy, featuring a special section on hardware description and simulation tools.\n"},"chapter01/01-Background.html":{"url":"chapter01/01-Background.html","title":"1.Background","keywords":"","body":"1.1 Background\n\n  This chapter focuses on the construction of a family of simple chips called Boolean gates. Since Boolean gates are physical implementations of Boolean functions, we start with a brief treatment of Boolean algebra. We then show how Boolean gates implementing simple Boolean functions can be interconnected to deliver the functionality of more complex chips. We conclude the background section with a description of how hardware design is actually done in practice, using software simulation tools.\n1.1.1 BooleanAlgebra\n  Boolean algebra deals with Boolean (also called binary) values that are typically labeled true/false, 1/0, yes/no, on/off, and so forth. We will use 1 and 0. A Boolean function is a function that operates on binary inputs and returns binary outputs. Since computer hardware is based on the representation and manipulation of binary values, Boolean functions play a central role in the specification, construction, and optimization of hardware architectures. Hence, the ability to formulate and analyze Boolean functions is the first step toward constructing computer architectures.\n  Truth Table Representation The simplest way to specify a Boolean function is to enumerate all the possible values of the function’s input variables, along with the function’s output for each set of inputs. This is called the truth table representation of the function, illustrated in figure 1.1.\n  The first three columns of figure 1.1 enumerate all the possible binary values of the function’s variables. For each one of the 2^n possible tuples υ1...υn(here n = 3), the last column gives the value of f(υ1...υn).\n  Boolean Expressions In addition to the truth table specification, a Boolean function can also be specified using Boolean operations over its input variables. The basic Boolean operators that are typically used are “And” (x And y is 1 exactly when both x and y are 1) “Or” (x Or y is 1 exactly when either x or y or both are 1), and “Not” (Not x is 1 exactly when x is 0). We will use a common arithmetic-like notation for these operations: x · y (or xy) means x And y, x + y means x Or y, and means Not x.\n  To illustrate, the function defined in figure 1.1 is equivalently given by the Boolean expression f(x, y, z) = (x + y) · z. For example, let us evaluate this expression on the inputs x = 0, y = 1, z = 0 (third row in the table). Since y is 1, it follows that x + y = 1 and thus 0. The complete verification of the equivalence between the expression and the truth table is achieved by evaluating the expression on each of the eight possible input combinations, verifying that it yields the same value listed in the table’s right column.\n\n\n  Figure 1.1 Truth table representation of a Boolean function (example).\n  Canonical Representation As it turns out, every Boolean function can be expressed using at least one Boolean expression called the canonical representation. Starting with the function’s truth table, we focus on all the rows in which the function has value 1. For each such row, we construct a termcreated byAnding together literals (variables or their negations) that fix the values of all the row’s inputs. For example, let us focus on the third row in figure 1.1, where the function’s value is 1. Since the variable values in this row are x = 0, y = 1, z = 0, we construct the term xyz. Following the same procedure, we construct the terms xyz and xyz for rows 5 and 7. Now, if we Or-together all these terms (for all the rows where the function has value 1), we get a Boolean expression that is equivalent to the given truth table. Thus the canonical representation of the Boolean function shown in figure 1.1 is f(x, y, z) = xyz + xyz + xyz. This construction leads to an important conclusion: Every Boolean function, no matter how complex, can be expressed using three Boolean operators only: And, Or, and Not.\n  Two-Input Boolean Functions An inspection of figure 1.1 reveals that the number of Boolean functions that can be defined over n binary variables is 2^2^n. For example, the sixteen Boolean functions spanned by two variables are listed in figure 1.2. These functions were constructed systematically, by enumerating all the possible 4-wise combinations of binary values in the four right columns. Each function has a conventional name that seeks to describe its underlying operation. Here are some examples: The name of the Nor function is shorthand for Not-Or: Take the Or of x and y, then negate the result. The Xor function——shorthand for “exclusive or”——returns 1 when its two variables have opposing truth-values and 0 otherwise. Conversely, the Equivalence function returns 1 when the two variables have identical truthvalues. The If-x-then-y function (also known as x → y, or “x Implies y”) returns 1 when x is 0 or when both x and y are 1. The other functions are self-explanatory.\n\n\n  Figure 1.2 All the Boolean functions of two variables.\n  The Nand function (as well as the Nor function) has an interesting theoretical property: Each one of the operations And, Or, and Not can be constructed from it, and it alone (e.g., x Or y = (x Nand x) Nand (y Nand y). And since every Boolean function can be constructed fromAnd, Or, and Not operations using the canonical representation method, it follows that every Boolean function can be constructed from Nand operations alone. This result has far-reaching practical implications: Once we have in our disposal a physical device that implements Nand, we can use many copies of this device (wired in a certain way) to implement in hardware any Boolean function.\n1.1.2 Gate Logic\n  A gate is a physical device that implements a Boolean function. If a Boolean function f operates on n variables and returns m binary results (in all our examples so far, m was 1), the gate that implements f will have n input pins and m output pins. When we put some values v1...vn in the gate’s input pins, the gate’s “logic”——its internal structure——should compute and output f(υ1...υn). And just like complex Boolean functions can be expressed in terms of simpler functions, complex gates are composed frommore elementary gates. The simplest gates of all are made from tiny switching devices, called transistors, wired in a certain topology designed to effect the overall gate functionality.\n  Although most digital computers today use electricity to represent and transmit binary data from one gate to another, any alternative technology permitting switching and conducting capabilities can be employed. Indeed, during the last fifty years, researchers have built many hardware implementations of Boolean functions, including magnetic, optical, biological, hydraulic, and pneumatic mechanisms. Today, most gates are implemented as transistors etched in silicon, packaged as chips. In this book we use the words chip and gate interchangeably, tending to use the termgates for simple chips.\n  The availability of alternative switching technology options, on the one hand, and the observation that Boolean algebra can be used to abstract the behavior of any such technology, on the other, is extremely important. Basically, it implies that computer scientists don’t have to worry about physical things like electricity, circuits, switches, relays, and power supply. Instead, computer scientists can be content with the abstract notions of Boolean algebra and gate logic, trusting that someone else (the physicists and electrical engineers—bless their souls) will figure out how to actually realize themin hardware. Hence, a primitive gate (see figure 1.3) can be viewed as a black box device that implements an elementary logical operation in one way or another—we don’t care how. A hardware designer starts from such primitive gates and designs more complicated functionality by interconnecting them, leading to the construction of composite gates.\n\n\n  Figure 1.3 Standard symbolic notation of some elementary logic gates.\n\n\n  Figure 1.4 Composite implementation of a three-way And gate. The rectangle on the right defines the conceptual boundaries of the gate interface.\n  Primitive and Composite Gates Since all logic gates have the same input and output semantics (0’s and 1’s), they can be chained together, creating composite gates of arbitrary complexity. For example, suppose we are asked to implement the 3-way Boolean function And(a, b, c). Using Boolean algebra, we can begin by observing that a·b·c = (a·b)·c, or, using prefix notation, And(a, b, c) = And(And(a, b), c). Next, we can use this result to construct the composite gate depicted in figure 1.4.\n  The construction described in figure 1.4 is a simple example of gate logic, also called logic design. Simply put, logic design is the art of interconnecting gates in order to implement more complex functionality, leading to the notion of composite gates. Since composite gates are themselves realizations of (possibly complex) Boolean functions, their “outside appearance” (e.g., left side of figure 1.4) looks just like that of primitive gates. At the same time, their internal structure can be rather complex.\n  We see that any given logic gate can be viewed from two different perspectives: external and internal. The right-hand side of figure 1.4 gives the gate’s internal architecture, or implementation, whereas the left side shows only the gate interface, namely, the input and output pins that it exposes to the outside world. The former is relevant only to the gate designer, whereas the latter is the right level of detail for other designers who wish to use the gate as an abstract off-the-shelf component, without paying attention to its internal structure.\n  Let us consider another logic design example—that of a Xor gate. As discussed before, Xor(a, b) is 1 exactly when either a is 1 and b is 0, or when a is 0 and b is 1. Said otherwise, Xor(a, b) = Or(And(a, Not(b)), And(Not(a), b)). This definition leads to the logic design shown in figure 1.5.\n  Note that the gate interface is unique: There is only one way to describe it, and this is normally done using a truth table, a Boolean expression, or some verbal specifica-tion. This interface, however, can be realized using many different implementations, some of which will be better than others in terms of cost, speed, and simplicity. For example, the Xor function can be implemented using four, rather than five, And, Or, and Not gates. Thus, from a functional standpoint, the fundamental requirement of logic design is that the gate implementation will realize its stated interface, in one way or another. From an efficiency standpoint, the general rule is to try to do more with less, that is, use as few gates as possible.\n\n\n  Figure 1.5 Xor gate, along with a possible implementation.\n  To sum up, the art of logic design can be described as follows: Given a gate specification (interface), find an efficient way to implement it using other gates that were already implemented. This, in a nutshell, is what we will do in the rest of this chapter.\n1.1.3 Actual Hardware Construction\n  Having described the logic of composing complex gates from simpler ones, we are now in a position to discuss how gates are actually built. Let us start with an intentionally naïve example.\n  Suppose we open a chip fabrication shop in our home garage. Our first contract is to build a hundred Xor gates. Using the order’s downpayment, we purchase a soldering gun, a roll of copper wire, and three bins labeled “And gates,” “Or gates,” and “Not gates,” each containing many identical copies of these elementary logic gates. Each of these gates is sealed in a plastic casing that exposes some input and output pins, as well as a power supply plug. To get started, we pin figure 1.5 to our garage wall and proceed to realize it using our hardware. First, we take two And gates, two Not gates, and one Or gate, and mount them on a board according to the figure’s layout. Next, we connect the chips to one another by running copper wires among them and by soldering the wire ends to the respective input/output pins. Now, if we follow the gate diagram carefully, we will end up having three exposed wire ends. We then solder a pin to each one of these wire ends, seal the entire device (except for the three pins) in a plastic casing, and label it “Xor.” We can repeat this assembly process many times over. At the end of the day, we can store all the chips that we’ve built in a new bin and label it “Xor gates.” If we (or other people) are asked to construct some other chips in the future, we’ll be able to use these Xor gates as elementary building blocks, just as we used the And, Or, and Not gates before.\n  As the reader has probably sensed, the garage approach to chip production leaves much to be desired. For starters, there is no guarantee that the given chip diagram is correct. Although we can prove correctness in simple cases like Xor, we cannot do so in many realistically complex chips. Thus, we must settle for empirical testing: Build the chip, connect it to a power supply, activate and deactivate the input pins in various configurations, and hope that the chip outputs will agree with its specifications. If the chip fails to deliver the desired outputs, we will have to tinker with its physical structure—a rather messy affair. Further, even if we will come up with the right design, replicating the chip assembly process many times over will be a time-consuming and error-prone affair. There must be a better way!\n1.1.4 Hardware Description Language (HDL)\n  Today, hardware designers no longer build anything with their bare hands. Instead, they plan and optimize the chip architecture on a computer workstation, using structured modeling formalisms like Hardware Description Language, or HDL (also known as VHDL, where V stands for Virtual). The designer specifies the chip structure by writing an HDL program, which is then subjected to a rigorous battery of tests. These tests are carried out virtually, using computer simulation: A special software tool, called a hardware simulator, takes the HDL program as input and builds an image of the modeled chip in memory. Next, the designer can instruct the simulator to test the virtual chip on various sets of inputs, generating simulated chip outputs. The outputs can then be compared to the desired results, as mandated by the client who ordered the chip built.\n  In addition to testing the chip’s correctness, the hardware designer will typically be interested in a variety of parameters such as speed of computation, energy consumption, and the overall cost implied by the chip design. All these parameters can be simulated and quantified by the hardware simulator, helping the designer optimize the design until the simulated chip delivers desired cost/performance levels.\n  Thus, using HDL, one can completely plan, debug, and optimize the entire chip before a single penny is spent on actual production. When the HDL program is deemed complete, that is, when the performance of the simulated chip satisfies the client who ordered it, the HDL program can become the blueprint from which many copies of the physical chip can be stamped in silicon. This final step in the chip life cycle——from an optimized HDL program to mass production——is typically out-sourced to companies that specialize in chip fabrication, using one switching technology or another.\n  Example: Building a XorGate As we have seen in figures 1.2 and 1.5, one way to define exclusive or is Xor(a, b) = Or(And(a, Not(b)), And(Not(a), b)). This logic can be expressed either graphically, as a gate diagram, or textually, as an HDL program. The latter program is written in the HDL variant used throughout this book, defined in appendix A. See figure 1.6 for the details.\n  Explanation An HDL definition of a chip consists of a header section and a parts section. The header section specifies the chip interface, namely the chip name and the names of its input and output pins. The parts section describes the names and topology of all the lower-level parts (other chips) from which this chip is constructed. Each part is represented by a statement that specifies the part name and the way it is connected to other parts in the design. Note that in order to write such statements legibly, the HDL programmer must have a complete documentation of the underlying parts’ interfaces. For example, figure 1.6 assumes that the input and output pins of the Not gate are labeled in and out, and those of And and Or are labeled a, b and out. This API-type information is not obvious, and one must have access to it before one can plug the chip parts into the present code.\n  Inter-part connections are described by creating and connecting internal pins, as needed. For example, consider the bottom of the gate diagram, where the output of a Not gate is piped into the input of a subsequent And gate. The HDL code describes this connection by the pair of statements Not(...,out=nota) and And(a=nota,...). The first statement creates an internal pin (outbound wire) named nota, feeding out into it. The second statement feeds the value of nota into the a input of an And gate. Note that pins may have an unlimited fan out. For example, in figure 1.6, each input is simultaneously fed into two gates. In gate diagrams, multiple connections are described using forks. In HDL, the existence of forks is implied by the code.\n\n\n  Figure 1.6 HDL implementation of a Xor gate.\n  Testing Rigorous quality assurance mandates that chips be tested in a specific, replicable, and welldocumented fashion. With that in mind, hardware simulators are usually designed to run test scripts, written in some scripting language. For example, the test script in figure 1.6 is written in the scripting language understood by the hardware simulator supplied with the book. This scripting language is described fully in appendix B.\n  Let us give a brief description of the test script from figure 1.6. The first two lines of the test script instruct the simulator to load the Xor.hdl program and get ready to print the values of selected variables. Next, the script lists a series of testing scenarios, designed to simulate the various contingencies under which the Xor chip will have to operate in “real-life” situations. In each scenario, the script instructs the simulator to bind the chip inputs to certain data values, compute the resulting output, and record the test results in a designated output file. In the case of simple gates like Xor, one can write an exhaustive test script that enumerates all the possible input values of the gate. The resulting output file (right side of figure 1.6) can then be viewed as a complete empirical proof that the chip is well designed. The luxury of such certitude is not feasible in more complex chips, as we will see later.\n1.1.5 Hardware Simulation\n  Since HDL is a hardware construction language, the process of writing and debugging HDL programs is quite similar to software development. The main difference is that instead of writing code in a language like Java, we write it in HDL, and instead of using a compiler to translate and test the code, we use a hardware simulator. The hardware simulator is a computer programthat knows how to parse and interpret HDL code, turn it into an executable representation, and test it according to the specifications of a given test script. There exist many commercial hardware simulators on the market, and these vary greatly in terms of cost, complexity, and ease of use. Together with this book we provide a simple (and free!) hardware simulator that is sufficiently powerful to support sophisticated hardware design projects. In particular, the simulator provides all the necessary tools for building, testing, and integrating all the chips presented in the book, leading to the construction of a general-purpose computer. Figure 1.7 illustrates a typical chip simulation session.\n"},"chapter01/02-Specification.html":{"url":"chapter01/02-Specification.html","title":"2.Specification","keywords":"","body":"1.2 Specification\n\n  This section specifies a typical set of gates, each designed to carry out a common Boolean operation. These gates will be used in the chapters that follow to construct the full architecture of a typical modern computer. Our starting point is a single primitive Nand gate, from which all other gates will be derived recursively. Note that we provide only the gates’ specifications, or interfaces, delaying implementation details until a subsequent section. Readers who wish to construct the specified gates in HDL are encouraged to do so, referring to appendix A as needed. All the gates can be built and simulated on a personal computer, using the hardware simulator supplied with the book.\n\n\n  Figure 1.7 A screen shot of simulating an Xor chip on the hardware simulator. The simulator state i shown just after the test script has completed running. The pin values correspond to the last simulatio step (a = b = 1). Note that the output file generated by the simulation is consistent with the Xor truth table indicating that the loaded HDL program delivers a correct Xor functionality. The compare file, not show in the figure and typically specified by the chip’s client, has exactly the same structure and contents as tha of the output file. The fact that the two files agree with each other is evident from the status messag displayed at the bottomof the screen.\n1.2.1 The NandGate\n  The starting point of our computer architecture is the Nand gate, from which all other gates and chips are built. The Nand gate is designed to compute the following Boolean function:\n\n\n  Throughout the book, we use “chip API boxes” to specify chips. For each chip, the API specifies the chip name, the names of its input and output pins, the function or operation that the chip effects, and an optional comment.\n\n\n\n1.2.2 Basic Logic Gates\n  Some of the logic gates presented here are typically referred to as “elementary” or “basic.” At the same time, every one of them can be composed from Nand gates alone. Therefore, they need not be viewed as primitive.\n  Not The single-input Not gate, also known as “converter,” converts its input from 0 to 1 and vice versa. The gate API is as follows:\n\n\n  And The And function returns 1 when both its inputs are 1, and 0 otherwise.\n\n\n  Or The Or function returns 1 when at least one of its inputs is 1, and 0 otherwise.\n\n\n  Xor The Xor function, also known as “exclusive or,” returns 1 when its two inputs have opposing values, and 0 otherwise.\n\n\n  Multiplexor A multiplexor (figure 1.8) is a three-input gate that uses one of the inputs, called “selectio bit,” to select and output one of the other two inputs, called “data bits.” Thus, a better name for thi device might have been selector. The name multiplexor was adopted from communications systems where similar devices are used to serialize (multiplex) several input signals over a single output wire.\n\n\n\n\n  Figure 1.8 Multiplexor. The table at the top right is an abbreviated version of the truth table on the left.\n\n\n  Figure 1.9 Demultiplexor.\n\n\n\n\n1.2.3 Multi-Bit Versions of Basic Gates\n  Computer hardware is typically designed to operate on multi-bit arrays called “buses.” For example, a basic requirement of a 32-bit computer is to be able to compute (bit-wise) an And function on two given 32-bit buses. To implement this operation, we can build an array of 32 binary And gates, each operating separately on a pair of bits. In order to enclose all this logic in one package, we can encapsulate the gates array in a single chip interface consisting of two 32-bit input buses and one 32-bit output bus.\n  This section describes a typical set of such multi-bit logic gates, as needed for the construction of a typical 16-bit computer. We note in passing that the architecture of n-bit logic gates is basically the same irrespective of n’s value.\n  When referring to individual bits in a bus, it is common to use an array syntax. For example, to refer to individual bits in a 16-bit bus named data, we use the notation data [0], data [1],..., data[15].\n  Multi-Bit Not An n-bit Not gate applies the Boolean operation Not to every one of the bits in its n-bit input bus:\n\n\n  Multi-Bit And An n-bit And gate applies the Boolean operation And to every one of the n bit-pairs arrayed in its two n-bit input buses:\n\n\n  Multi-Bit Or An n-bit Or gate applies the Boolean operation Or to every one of the n bit-pairs arrayed in its two n-bit input buses:\n\n\n  Multi-Bit Multiplexor An n-bit multiplexor is exactly the same as the binary multiplexor described in figure 1.8, except that the two inputs are each n-bit wide; the selector is a single bit.\n\n\n\n\n1.2.4 Multi-Way Versions of Basic Gates\n  Many 2-way logic gates that accept two inputs have natural generalization to multi-way variants that accept an arbitrary number of inputs. This section describes a set of multi-way gates that will be used subsequently in various chips in our computer architecture. Similar generalizations can be developed for other architectures, as needed.\n  Multi-Way Or An n-way Or gate outputs 1 when at least one of its n bit inputs is 1, and 0 otherwise. Here is the 8-way variant of this gate:\n\n\n  Multi-Way/Multi-Bit Multiplexor An m-way n-bit multiplexor selects one of m n-bit input buses and outputs it to a single n-bit output bus. The selection is specified by a set of k control bits, where k = log2m. Figure 1.10 depicts a typical example.\n  The computer platform that we develop in this book requires two variations of this chip: A 4-way 16-bit multiplexor and an 8-way 16-bit multiplexor:\n\n\n  Figure 1.10 4-way multiplexor. The width of the input and output buses may vary.\n\n\n\n  Multi-Way/Multi-Bit Demultiplexor An m-way n-bit demultiplexor (figure 1.11) channels a single n-bit input into one of m possible n-bit outputs. The selection is specified by a set of k control bits, where k = log2m.\n  The specific computer platform that we will build requires two variations of this chip: A 4-way 1-bit demultiplexor and an 8-way 1-bit multiplexor, as follows.\n\n\n  Figure 1.11 4-way demultiplexor.\n\n\n"},"chapter01/03-Implementation.html":{"url":"chapter01/03-Implementation.html","title":"3.Implementation","keywords":"","body":"1.3 Implementation\n\n  Similar to the role of axioms in mathematics, primitive gates provide a set of elementary building blocks from which everything else can be built. Operationally, primitive gates have an “off-the-shelf” implementation that is supplied externally. Thus, they can be used in the construction of other gates and chips without worrying about their internal design. In the computer architecture that we are now beginning to build, we have chosen to base all the hardware on one primitive gate only: Nand. We now turn to outlining the first stage of this bottom-up hardware construction project, one gate at a time.\n  Our implementation guidelines are intentionally partial, since we want you to discover the actual gate architectures yourself. We reiterate that each gate can be implemented in more than one way; the simpler the implementation, the better.\n  Not: The implementation of a unary Not gate froma binary Nand gate is simple. Tip: Think positive.\n  And: Once again, the gate implementation is simple. Tip: Think negative.\n  Or/Xor: These functions can be defined in terms of some of the Boolean functions implemented previously, using some simple Boolean manipulations. Thus, the respective gates can be built using previously built gates.\n  Multiplexor/ Demultiplexor: Likewise, these gates can be built using previously built gates.\n  Multi-Bit Not/And/Or Gates: Since we already know how to implement the elementary versions of these gates, the implementation of their n-ary versions is simply a matter of constructing arrays of n elementary gates, having each gate operate separately on its bit inputs. This implementation task is rather boring, but it will carry its weight when these multi-bit gates are used in more complex chips, as described in subsequent chapters.\n  Multi-Bit Multiplexor: The implementation of an n-ary multiplexor is simply a matter of feeding the same selection bit to every one of n binary multiplexors. Again, a boring task resulting in a very useful chip.\n  Multi-Way Gates: Implementation tip: Think forks.\n"},"chapter01/04-Perspective.html":{"url":"chapter01/04-Perspective.html","title":"4.Perspective","keywords":"","body":"1.4 Perspective\n\n  This chapter described the first steps taken in an applied digital design project. In the next chapter we will build more complicated functionality using the gates built here. Although we have chosen to use Nand as our basic building block, other approaches are possible. For example, one can build a complete computer platform using Nor gates alone, or, alternatively, a combination of And, Or, and Not gates. These constructive approaches to logic design are theoretically equivalent, just as all theorems in geometry can be founded on different sets of axioms as alternative points of departure. The theory and practice of such constructions are covered in standard textbooks about digital design or logic design.\n  Throughout the chapter, we paid no attention to efficiency considerations such as the number of elementary gates used in constructing a composite gate or the number of wire crossovers implied by the design. Such considerations are critically important in practice, and a great deal of computer science and electrical engineering expertise focuses on optimizing them. Another issue we did not address at all is the physical implementation of gates and chips using the laws of physics, for example, the role of transistors embedded in silicon. There are of course several such implementation options, each having its own characteristics (speed, power requirements, production cost, etc.). Any nontrivial coverage of these issues requires some background in electronics and physics.\n"},"chapter01/05-Project.html":{"url":"chapter01/05-Project.html","title":"5.Project","keywords":"","body":"1.5 Project\n\n  Objective Implement all the logic gates presented in the chapter. The only building blocks that you can use are primitive Nand gates and the composite gates that you will gradually build on top of them.\n  Resources The only tool that you need for this project is the hardware simulator supplied with the book. All the chips should be implemented in the HDL language specified in appendix A. For each one of the chips mentioned in the chapter, we provide a skeletal .hdl program (text file) with a missing implementation part. In addition, for each chip we provide a .tst script file that tells the hardware simulator how to test it, along with the correct output file that this script should generate, called .cmp or “compare file.” Your job is to complete the missing implementation parts of the supplied .hdl programs.\n  Contract When loaded into the hardware simulator, your chip design (modified .hdl program), tested on the supplied .tst file, should produce the outputs listed in the supplied .cmp file. If that is not the case, the simulator will let you know.\n  Tips The Nand gate is considered primitive and thus there is no need to build it: Whenever you use Nand in one of your HDL programs, the simulator will automatically invoke its built-in tools/builtIn/Nand.hdl implementation. We recommend implementing the other gates in this project in the order in which they appear in the chapter. However, since the builtIn directory features working versions of all the chips described in the book, you can always use these chips without defining them first: The simulator will automatically use their built-in versions.\n\nFor example, consider the skeletal Mux.hdl program supplied in this project. Suppose that for one reason or another you did not complete this program’s implementation, but you still want to use Mux gates as internal parts in other chip designs. This is not a problem, thanks to the following convention. If our simulator fails to find a Mux.hdl file in the current directory, it automatically invokes a built-in Mux implementation, pre-supplied with the simulator’s software. This built-in implementation—a Java class stored in the built In directory—has the same interface and functionality as those of the Mux gate described in the book. Thus, if you want the simulator to ignore one or more of your chip implementations, simply move the corresponding .hdl files out of the current directory.\n\n  Steps We recommend proceeding in the following order:\n\nThe hardware simulator needed for this project is available in the tools directory of the book’s software suite.\nRead appendix A, sections A1-A6 only.\nGo through the hardware simulator tutorial, parts I, II, and III only.\nBuild and simulate all the chips specified in the projects/01 directory.\n\n"},"chapter02/00-Boolean_Arithmetic.html":{"url":"chapter02/00-Boolean_Arithmetic.html","title":"02. Boolean Arithmetic","keywords":"","body":"Chapter 2: Boolean Arithmetic\n\n\n\n  Counting is the religion of this generation, its hope and salvation.\n——Gertrude Stein (1874-1946)\n\n\n  In this chapter we build gate logic designs that represent numbers and perform arithmetic operations on them. Our starting point is the set of logic gates built in chapter 1, and our ending point is a fully functional Arithmetic Logical Unit. The ALU is the centerpiece chip that executes all the arithmetic and logical operations performed by the computer. Hence, building the ALU functionality is an important step toward understanding how the Central Processing Unit (CPU) and the overall computer work.\n  As usual, we approach this task gradually. The first section gives a brief Background on how binary codes and Boolean arithmetic can be used, respectively, to represent and add signed numbers. The Specification section describes a succession of adder chips, designed to add two bits, three bits, and pairs of n-bit binary numbers. This sets the stage for the ALU specification, which is based on a sophisticated yet simple logic design. The Implementation and Project sections provide tips and guidelines on how to build the adder chips and the ALU on a personal computer, using the hardware simulator supplied with the book.\n  Binary addition is a simple operation that runs deep. Remarkably, most of the operations performed by digital computers can be reduced to elementary additions of binary numbers. Therefore, constructive understanding of binary addition holds the key to the implementation of numerous computer operations that depend on it, one way or another.\n"},"chapter02/01-Background.html":{"url":"chapter02/01-Background.html","title":"1.Background","keywords":"","body":"2.1 Background\n\n  Binary Numbers Unlike the decimal system, which is founded on base 10, the binary system is founded on base 2. When we are given a certain binary pattern, say “10011,” and we are told that this pattern is supposed to represent an integer number, the decimal value of this number is computed by convention as follows:\n\n\n(1) In general, let x = xnxn-1 ...x0 be a string of digits. The value of x in base b, denoted (x)b, is defined as follows:\n\n\n(2) The reader can verify that in the case of (10011)two, rule (2) reduces to calculation (1). The result of calculation (1) happens to be 19. Thus, when we press the keyboard keys labeled ‘1’, ‘9’ and ENTER while running, say, a spreadsheet program, what ends up in some register in the computer’s memory is the binary code 10011. More precisely, if the computer happens to be a 32-bit machine, what gets stored in the register is the bit pattern 00000000000000000000000000010011.\n  Binary Addition A pair of binary numbers can be added digit by digit from right to left, according to the same elementary school method used in decimal addition. First, we add the two right-most digits, also called the least significant bits (LSB) of the two binary numbers. Next, we add the resulting carry bit (which is either 0 or 1) to the sum of the next pair of bits up the significance ladder. We continue the process until the two most significant bits (MSB) are added. If the last bit-wise addition generates a carry of 1, we can report overflow; otherwise, the addition completes successfully:\n\n\n  We see that computer hardware for binary addition of two n-bit numbers can be built from logic gates designed to calculate the sum of three bits (pair of bits plus carry bit). The transfer of the resulting carry bit forward to the addition of the next significant pair of bits can be easily accomplished by proper wiring of the 3-bit adder gates.\n  Signed Binary Numbers A binary system with n digits can generate a set of 2n different bit patterns. If we have to represent signed numbers in binary code, a natural solution is to split this space into two equal subsets. One subset of codes is assigned to represent positive numbers, and the other negative numbers. Ideally, the coding scheme should be chosen in such a way that the introduction of signed numbers would complicate the hardware implementation as little as possible. This challenge has led to the development of several coding schemes for representing signed numbers in binary code. The method used today by almost all computers is called the 2’s complement method, also known as radix complement. In a binary system with n digits, the 2’s complement of the number x is defined as follows:\n\n\n  For example, in a 5-bit binary system, the 2’s complement representation of–2 or “minus(00010)two” is 25–(00010)two = (32)ten–(2)ten = (30)ten = (11110)two. To check the calculation, the reader can verify that (00010)two + (11110)two = (00000)two. Note that in the latter computation, the sum is actually (100000)two, but since we are dealing with a 5-bit binary system, the left-most sixth bit is simply ignored. As a rule, when the 2’s complement method is applied to n-bit numbers, x + (–x) always sums up to 2n (i.e., 1 followed by n 0’s)—a property that gives the method its name. Figure 2.1 illustrates a 4-bit binary systemwith the 2’s complement method.\n  An inspection of figure 2.1 suggests that an n-bit binary system with 2’s complement representation has the following properties:\n\n\n  Figure 2.1 2’s complement representation of signed numbers in a 4-bit binary system.\n  ■ The systemcan code a total of 2n signed numbers, of which the maximal and minimal numbers are 2n-1–1 and–2n-1, respectively.\n  ■ The codes of all positive numbers begin with a 0.\n  ■ The codes of all negative numbers begin with a 1.\n  ■ To obtain the code of–x fromthe code of x, leave all the trailing (least significant) 0’s and the first least significant 1 intact, then flip all the remaining bits (convert 0’s to 1’s and vice versa). An equivalent shortcut, which is easier to implement in hardware, is to flip all the bits of x and add 1 to the result.\n  A particularly attractive feature of this representation is that addition of any two signed numbers in 2’s complement is exactly the same as addition of positive numbers. Consider, for example, the addition operation (–2) + (–3). Using 2’s complement (in a 4-bit representation), we have to add, in binary, (1110)two + (1101)two. Without paying any attention to which numbers (positive or negative) these codes represent, bit-wise addition will yield 1011 (after throwing away the overflow bit). As figure 2.1 shows, this indeed is the 2’s complement representation of -5.\n  In short, we see that the 2’s complement method facilitates the addition of any two signed numbers without requiring special hardware beyond that needed for simple bit-wise addition. What about subtraction? Recall that in the 2’s complement method, the arithmetic negation of a signed number x, that is, computing–x, is achieved by negating all the bits of x and adding 1 to the result. Thus subtraction can be easily handled by x–y = x + (–y). Once again, hardware complexity is kept to a minimum.\n  The material implications of these theoretical results are significant. Basically, they imply that a single chip, called Arithmetic Logical Unit, can be used to encapsulate all the basic arithmetic and logical operators performed in hardware. We now turn to specify one suchALU, beginning with the specification of an adder chip.\n"},"chapter02/02-Specification.html":{"url":"chapter02/02-Specification.html","title":"2.Specification","keywords":"","body":"2.2 Specification\n\n2.2.1 Adders\n  We present a hierarchy of three adders, leading to a multi-bit adder chip:\n\nHalf-adder: designed to add two bits\nFull-adder: designed to add three bits\nAdder: designed to add two n-bit numbers\n\n\n\n  Figure 2.2 Half-adder, designed to add 2 bits.\n  We also present a special-purpose adder, called incrementer, designed to add 1 to a given number.\n  Half-Adder The first step on our way to adding binary numbers is to be able to add two bits. Let us call the least significant bit of the addition sum, and the most significant bit carry. Figure 2.2 presents a chip, called half-adder, designed to carry out this operation.\n  Full-Adder Now that we know how to add two bits, figure 2.3 presents a full-adder chip, designed to add three bits. Like the half-adder case, the full-adder chip produces two outputs: the least significant bit of the addition, and the carry bit.\n  Adder Memory and register chips represent integer numbers by n-bit patterns, n being 16, 32, 64, and so forth—depending on the computer platform. The chip whose job is to add such numbers is called a multibit adder, or simply adder. Figure 2.4 presents a 16-bit adder, noting that the same logic and specifications scale up as is to any n-bit adder.\n  Incrementer It is convenient to have a special-purpose chip dedicated to adding the constant 1 to a given\nnumber. Here is the specification of a 16-bit incrementer:\n\n\n  Figure 2.3 Full-adder, designed to add 3 bits.\n\n\n  Figure 2.4 16-bit adder. Addition of two n-bit binary numbers for any n is “more of the same.”\n\n\n\n\n2.2.2 The Arithmetic Logic Unit (ALU)\n  The specifications of the adder chips presented so far were generic, meaning that they hold for any computer. In contrast, this section describes an ALU that will later become the centerpiece of a specific computer platform called Hack. At the same time, the principles underlying the design of our ALU are rather general. Further, our ALU architecture achieves a great deal of functionality using a minimal set of internal parts. In that respect, it provides a good example of an efficient and elegant logic design.\n  The Hack ALU computes a fixed set of functions out = fi(x, y) where x and y are the chip’s two 16-bit inputs, out is the chip’s 16-bit output, and fi is an arithmetic or logical function selected from a fixed repertoire of eighteen possible functions. We instruct the ALU which function to compute by setting six input bits, called control bits, to selected binary values. The exact input-output specification is given in figure 2.5, using pseudo-code.\n  Note that each one of the six control bits instructs the ALU to carry out a certain elementary operation. Taken together, the combined effects of these operations cause the ALU to compute a variety of useful functions. Since the overall operation is driven by six control bits, the ALU can potentially compute 26 = 64 different functions. Eighteen of these functions are documented in figure 2.6.\n  We see that programming our ALU to compute a certain function f(x, y) is done by setting the six control bits to the code of the desired function. From this point on, the internal ALU logic specified in figure 2.5 should cause the ALU to output the value f(x, y) specified in figure 2.6. Of course, this does not happen miraculously, it’s the result of careful design.\n  For example, let us consider the twelfth row of figure 2.6, where the ALU is instructed to compute the function x-1. The zx and nx bits are 0, so the x input is neither zeroed nor negated. The zy and ny bits are 1, so the y input is first zeroed, and then negated bit-wise. Bit-wise negation of zero, (000 ...00)two , gives (111 ...11)two , the 2’s complement code of -1. Thus the ALU inputs end up being x and -1. Since the f-bit is 1, the selected operation is arithmetic addition, causing the ALU to calculate x+ (-1). Finally, since the no bit is 0, the output is not negated but rather left as is. To conclude, the ALU ends up computing x-1, which was our goal.\n\n\n\n\n  Figure 2.5 The Arithmetic Logic Unit.\n\n\n  Figure 2.6 The ALU truth table. Taken together, the binary operations coded by the first six columns effect the function listed in the right column (we use the symbols !, &, and | to represent the operators Not, And, and Or, respectively, performed bit-wise). The complete ALU truth table consists of sixty-four rows, of which only the eighteen presented here are of interest.\n  Does the ALU logic described in figure 2.6 compute every one of the other seventeen functions listed in the figure’s right column? To verify that this is indeed the case, the reader can pick up some other rows in the table and prove their respective ALU operation. We note that some of these computations, beginning with the function f(x, y) = 1, are not trivial. We also note that there are some other useful functions computed by the ALU but not listed in the figure.\n  It may be instructive to describe the thought process that led to the design of this particular ALU. First, we made a list of all the primitive operations that we wanted our computer to be able to perform (right column in figure 2.6). Next, we used backward reasoning to figure out how x, y, and out can be manipulated in binary fashion in order to carry out the desired operations. These processing requirements, along with our objective to keep the ALU logic as simple as possible, have led to the design decision to use six control bits, each associated with a straightforward binary operation. The resultingALU is simple and elegant. And in the hardware business, simplicity and elegance imply inexpensive and powerful computer systems.\n"},"chapter02/03-Implementation.html":{"url":"chapter02/03-Implementation.html","title":"3.Implementation","keywords":"","body":"2.3 Implementation\n\n  Our implementation guidelines are intentionally partial, since we want you to discover the actual chip architectures yourself. As usual, each chip can be implemented in more than one way; the simpler the implementation, the better.\n  Half-Adder An inspection of figure 2.2 reveals that the functions sum(a, b) and carry(a, b) happen to be identical to the standard Xor(a, b) and And(a, b) Boolean functions. Thus, the implementation of this adder is straightforward, using previously built gates.\n  Full-Adder A full adder chip can be implemented from two half adder chips and one additional simple gate. A direct implementation is also possible, without using half-adder chips.\n  Adder The addition of two signed numbers represented by the 2’s complement method as two n-bit buses can be done bit-wise, from right to left, in n steps. In step 0, the least significant pair of bits is added, and the carry bit is fed into the addition of the next significant pair of bits. The process continues until in step n–1 the most significant pair of bits is added. Note that each step involves the addition of three bits. Hence, an n-bit adder can be implemented by creating an array of n full-adder chips and propagating the carry bits up the significance ladder.\n  Incrementer An n-bit incrementer can be implemented trivially from an n-bit adder. ALU Note that our ALU was carefully planned to effect all the desired ALU operations logically, using simple Boolean operations. Therefore, the physical implementation of the ALU is reduced to implementing these simple Boolean operations, following their pseudo-code specifications. Your first step will likely be to create a logic circuit that manipulates a 16-bit input according to the nx and zx control bits (i.e., the circuit should conditionally zero and negate the 16-bit input). This logic can be used to manipulate the x and y inputs, as well as the out output. Chips for bit-wise And-ing and addition have already been built in this and in the previous chapter. Thus, what remains is to build logic that chooses between them according to the f control bit. Finally, you will need to build logic that integrates all the other chips into the overall ALU. (When we say “build logic,” we mean “write HDL code”).\n"},"chapter02/04-Perspective.html":{"url":"chapter02/04-Perspective.html","title":"4.Perspective","keywords":"","body":"2.4 Perspective\n\n  The construction of the multi-bit adder presented in this chapter was standard, although no attention was paid to efficiency. In fact, our suggested adder implementation is rather inefficient, due to the long delays incurred while the carry bit propagates from the least significant bit pair to the most significant bit pair. This problem can be alleviated using logic circuits that effect so-called carry look-ahead techniques. Since addition is one of the most prevalent operations in any given hardware platform, any such low-level improvement can result in dramatic and global performance gains throughout the computer.\n  In any given computer, the overall functionality of the hardware/software platform is delivered jointly by the ALU and the operating system that runs on top of it. Thus, when designing a new computer system, the question of how much functionality the ALU should deliver is essentially a cost/performance issue. The general rule is that hardware implementations of arithmetic and logical operations are usually more costly, but achieve better performance. The design trade-off that we have chosen in this book is to specify an ALU hardware with a limited functionality and then implement as many operations as possible in software. For example, our ALU features neither multiplication nor division nor floating point arithmetic. We will implement some of these operations (as well as more mathematical functions) at the operating systemlevel, described in chapter 12.\n  Detailed treatments of Boolean arithmetic and ALU design can be found in most computer architecture textbooks.\n"},"chapter02/05-Project.html":{"url":"chapter02/05-Project.html","title":"5.Project","keywords":"","body":"2.5 Project\n\n  Objective Implement all the chips presented in this chapter.

Universes of virtually unlimited complexity can be created in the form of computer programs\n——Joseph Weizenbaum, Computer Power and Human Reason (1974)\n\n\n  This chapter describes the first steps toward building a compiler for a typical object-based high-level language. We will approach this substantial task in two stages, each spanning two chapters. High-level programs will first be translated into an intermediate code (chapters 10—11), and the intermediate code will then be translated into machine language (chapters 7-8). This two-tier translation model is a rather old idea that goes back to the 1970s. Recently, it made a significant comeback following its adoption by modern languages like Java and C#.\n  The basic idea is as follows: Instead of running on a real platform, the intermediate code is designed to run on a Virtual Machine. The VM is an abstract computer that does not exist for real, but can rather be realized on other computer platforms. There are many reasons why this idea makes sense, one of which being code transportability. Since the VM may be implemented with relative ease on multiple target platforms, VM-based software can run on many processors and operating systems without having to modify the original source code. The VM implementations can be realized in several ways, by software interpreters, by special-purpose hardware, or by translating the VM programs into the machine language of the target platform.\n  This chapter presents a typical VM architecture, modeled after the Java Virtual Machine (JVM) paradigm. As usual, we focus on two perspectives. First, we motivate and specify the VM abstraction. Next, we implement it over the Hack platform. Our implementation entails writing a program called VM translator, designed to translate VM code into Hack assembly code. The software suite that comes with the book illustrates yet another implementation vehicle, called VM emulator. This programimplements the VM by emulating it on a standard personal computer using Java.\n  A virtual machine model typically has a language, in which one can write VM programs. The VM language that we present here consists of four types of commands: arithmetic, memory access, program flow, and subroutine calling commands. We split the implementation of this language into two parts, each covered in a separate chapter and project. In this chapter we build a basic VM translator, capable of translating the VM’s arithmetic and memory access commands into machine language. In the next chapter we extend the basic translator with program flow and subroutine calling functionality. The result is a fullscale virtual machine that will serve as the backend of the compiler that we will build in chapters 10-11.\n  The virtual machine that emerges from this effort illustrates many important ideas in computer science. First, the notion of having one computer emulating another is a fundamental idea in the field, tracing back to Alan Turing in the 1930s. Over the years it had many practical implications, for example, using an emulator of an old generation computer running on a new platform in order to achieve upward code compatibility. More recently, the virtual machine model became the centerpiece of two competing mainstreams—the Java architecture and the .NET infrastructure. These software environments are rather complex, and one way to gain an inside view of their underlying structure is to build a simple version of their VM cores, as we do here.\n  Another important topic embedded in this chapter is stack processing. The stack is a fundamental and elegant data structure that comes to play in many computer systems and algorithms. Since the VM presented in this chapter is stack-based, it provides a working example of this remarkably versatile data structure.\n"},"chapter07/01-Background.html":{"url":"chapter07/01-Background.html","title":"1.Background","keywords":"","body":"7.1 Background\n\n7.1.1 The Virtual Machine Paradigm\n  Before a high-level program can run on a target computer, it must be translated into the computer’s machine language. This translation—known as compilation—is a rather complex process. Normally, a separate compiler is written specifically for any given pair of high-level language and target machine language. This leads to a proliferation of many different compilers, each depending on every detail of both its source and destination languages. One way to decouple this dependency is to break the overall compilation process into two nearly separate stages. In the first stage, the high-level program is parsed and its commands are translated into intermediate processing steps—steps that are neither “high” nor “low.” In the second stage, the intermediate steps are translated further into the machine language of the target hardware.\n  This decomposition is very appealing from a software engineering perspective: The first stage depends only on the specifics of the source high-level language, and the second stage only on the specifics of the target machine language. Of course, the interface between the two compilation stages—the exact definition of the intermediate processing steps—must be carefully designed. In fact, this interface is sufficiently important to merit its own definition as a stand-alone language of an abstract machine. Specifically, one can formulate a virtual machine whose instructions are the intermediate processing steps into which high-level commands are decomposed. The compiler that was formerly a single monolithic program is now split into two separate programs. The first program, still termed compiler, translates the high-level code into intermediate VM instructions, while the second program translates this VM code into the machine language of the target platform.\n  This two-stage compilation model has been used—one way or another—in many compiler construction projects. Some developers went as far as defining a formal and stand-alone virtual machine language, most notably the p-code generated by several Pascal compilers in the 1970s. Java compilers are also two-tiered, generating a bytecode language that runs on the JVM virtual machine (also called the Java Runtime Environment). More recently, the approach has been adopted by the .NET infrastructure. In particular, .NET requires compilers to generate code written in an intermediate language (IL) that runs on a virtual machine called CLR (Common Language Runtime).\n  Indeed, the notion of an explicit and formal virtual machine language has several practical advantages. First, compilers for different target platforms can be obtained with relative ease by replacing only the virtual machine implementation (sometimes called the compiler’s backend). This, in turn, allows the VM code to become transportable across different hardware platforms, permitting a range of implementation trade-offs among code efficiency, hardware cost, and programming effort. Second, compilers for many languages can share the same VM backend, allowing code sharing and language interoperability. For example, one high-level language may be good at scientific calculations, while another may excel in handling the user interface. If both languages compile into a common VM layer, it is rather natural to have routines in one language call routines in the other, using an agreed-upon invocation syntax.\n  Another benefit of the virtual machine approach is modularity. Every improvement in the efficiency of the VM implementation is immediately inherited by all the compilers above it. Likewise, every new digital device or appliance that is equipped with a VM implementation can immediately benefit from a huge base of available software, as seen in figure 7.1.\n7.1.2 The Stack Machine Model\n  Like most programming languages, the VM language consists of arithmetic, memory access, programflow, and subroutine calling operations. There are several possible software paradigms on which to base such a language implementation. One of the key questions regarding this choice is where will the operands and the results of the VM operations reside? Perhaps the cleanest solution is to put them on a stack data structure.\n  In a stack machine model, arithmetic commands pop their operands from the top of the stack and push their results back onto the top of the stack. Other commands transfer data items from the stack’s top to designated memory locations, and vice versa. As it turns out, these simple stack operations can be used to implement the evaluation of any arithmetic or logical expression. Further, any program, written in any programming language, can be translated into an equivalent stack machine program. One such stack machine model is used in the Java Virtual Machine as well as in the VM described and built in what follows.\n  Elementary Stack Operations A stack is an abstract data structure that supports two basic operations: push and pop. The push operation adds an element to the top of the stack; the element that was previously on top is pushed below the newly added element. The pop operation retrieves and removes the top element; the element just below it moves up to the top position. Thus the stack implements a last-in-firstout (LIFO) storage model, illustrated in figure 7.2.\n  We see that stack access differs from conventional memory access in several respects. First, the stack is accessible only from the top, one item at a time. Second, reading the stack is a lossy operation: The only way to retrieve the top value is to remove it from the stack. In contrast, the act of reading a value from a regular memory location has no impact on the memory’s state. Finally, writing an item onto the stack adds it to the stack’s top, without changing the rest of the stack. In contrast, writing an item into a regular memory location is a lossy operation, since it overrides the location’s previous value.\n  The stack data structure can be implemented in several different ways. The simplest approach is to keep an array, say stack, and a stack pointer variable, say sp, that points to the available location just above the topmost element. The push x command is then implemented by storing x at the array entry pointed by sp and then incrementing sp (i.e., stack [sp]=x; sp=sp+1). The pop operation is implemented by first decrementing sp and then returning the value stored in the top position (i.e., sp=sp-1; return stack [sp]).\n\n\n  Figure 7.1 The virtual machine paradigm. Once a high-level program is compiled into VM code, the program can run on any hardware platform equipped with a suitable VM implementation. In this chapter we start building the VM implementation on the Hack platform and use a VM emulator like the one depicted on the right.\n\n\n  Figure 7.2 Stack processing example, illustrating the two elementary operations push and pop. Following convention, the stack is drawn upside down, as if it grows downward. The location just after the top position is always referred to by a special pointer called sp, or stack pointer. The labels a and b refer to two arbitrary memory addresses.\n  As usual in computer science, simplicity and elegance imply power of expression. The simple stack model is a versatile data structure that comes to play in many computer systems and algorithms. In the virtual machine architecture that we build here, it serves two key purposes. First, it is used for handling all the arithmetic and logical operations of the VM. Second, it facilitates subroutine calls and the associated memory allocation—the subjects of the next chapter.\n  Stack Arithmetic Stack-based arithmetic is a simple matter: the operands are popped from the stack, the required operation is performed on them, and the result is pushed back onto the stack. For example, here is how addition is handled:\n\n\n  The stack version of other operations (subtract, multiply, etc.) are precisely the same. For example, consider the expression d=(2-x)*(y+5), taken from some high-level program. The stack-based evaluation of this expression is shown in figure 7.3.\n  Stack-based evaluation of Boolean expressions has precisely the same flavor. For example, consider the high-level command if (x\n  The previous examples illustrate a general observation: any arithmetic and Boolean expression—no matter how complex—can be systematically converted into, and evaluated by, a sequence of simple operations on a stack. Thus, one can write a compiler that translates high-level arithmetic and Boolean expressions into sequences of stack commands, as we will do in chapters 10-11. We now turn to specify these commands (section 7.2), and describe their implementation on the Hack platform(section 7.3).\n"},"chapter07/02-VM_Specification_Part_I.html":{"url":"chapter07/02-VM_Specification_Part_I.html","title":"2.VM Specification, Part I","keywords":"","body":"7.2 VM Specification, Part I\n\n7.2.1 General\n  The virtual machine is stack-based: all operations are done on a stack. It is also function-based: a complete VM program is organized in program units called functions, written in the VM language. Each function has its own stand-alone code and is separately handled. The VM language has a single 16-bit data type that can be used as an integer, a Boolean, or a pointer. The language consists of four types of commands:\n    ■ Arithmetic commands performarithmetic and logical operations on the stack\n    ■ Memory access commands transfer data between the stack and virtual memory segments.\n    ■ Program flow commands facilitate conditional and unconditional branching operations.\n    ■ Function calling commands call functions and return fromthem.\n\n\n  Figure 7.3 Stack-based evaluation of arithmetic expressions. This example evaluates the expression d = (2 - x) * (y + 5), assuming the initial memory state x = 5, y = 9.\n\n\n  Figure 7.4 Stack-based evaluation of logical expressions. This example evaluates the Boolean expression (x \n  Building a virtual machine is a complex undertaking, and so we divide it into two stages. In this chapter we specify the arithmetic and memory access commands and build a basic VM translator that implements them only. The next chapter specifies the program flow and function calling commands and extends the basic translator into a full-scale virtual machine implementation.\n  Program and Command Structure A VM program is a collection of one or more files with a .vm extension, each consisting of one or more functions. From a compilation standpoint, these constructs correspond, respectively, to the notions of program, class, and method in an object-oriented language.\n  Within a .vm file, each VM command appears in a separate line, and in one of the following formats: command (e.g., add), command arg (e.g., goto loop), or command arg1 arg2 (e.g., push local 3). The arguments are separated from each other and from the command part by an arbitrary number of spaces. “//” comments can appear at the end of any line and are ignored. Blank lines are permitted and ignored.\n7.2.2 Arithmetic and Logical Commands\n  The VM language features nine stack-oriented arithmetic and logical commands. Seven of these commands are binary: They pop two items off the stack, compute a binary function on them, and push the result back onto the stack. The remaining two commands are unary: they pop a single item off the stack, compute a unary function on it, and push the result back onto the stack. We see that each command has the net impact of replacing its operand(s) with the command’s result, without affecting the rest of the stack. Figure 7.5 gives the details.\n  Three of the commands listed in figure 7.5 (eq, gt, lt) return Boolean values. The VM represents true and false as -1 (minus one, 0xFFFF) and 0 (zero, 0x0000), respectively.\n7.2.3 Memory Access Command\n  So far in the chapter, memory access commands were illustrated using the pseudo-commands pop and push x, where the symbol x referred to an individual location in some global memory. Yet formally, our VM manipulates eight separate virtual memory segments, listed in figure 7.6.\n\n\n  Figure 7.5 Arithmetic and logical stack commands.\n  Memory Access Commands All the memory segments are accessed by the same two commands:\n\npush segment index Push the value of segment[index] onto the stack.\npop segment index Pop the top stack value and store it in segment[index].\n\n\n\n  Figure 7.6 The memory segments seen by every VM function.\n\n\n  Figure 7.7 The virtual memory segments are maintained by the VM implementation.\n  Where segment is one of the eight segment names and index is a non-negative integer. For example, push argument 2 followed by pop local 1 will store the value of the function’s third argument in the function’s second local variable (each segment’s index starts at 0).\n  The relationship among VM files, VM functions, and their respective virtual memory segments is depicted in figure 7.7.\n  In addition to the eight memory segments, which are managed explicitly by VM push and pop commands, the VM implementation manages two implicit data structures called stack and heap. These data structures are never mentioned directly, but their states change in the background, as a side effect of VM commands.\n  The Stack Consider the commands sequence push argument 2 and pop local 1, mentioned before. The working memory of such VM operations is the stack. The data value did not simply jump from one segment to another—it went through the stack. Yet in spite of its central role in the VM architecture, the stack proper is never mentioned in the VM language.\n  The Heap Another memory element that exists in the VM’s background is the heap. The heap is the name of the RAM area dedicated for storing objects and arrays data. These objects and arrays can be manipulated by VM commands, as we will see shortly.\n7.2.4 Program Flow and Function Calling Commands\n  The VM features six additional commands that are discussed at length in the next chapter. For completeness, these commands are listed here.\n\n\n  Program Flow Commands\n\n\n  Function Calling Commands\n  (In this list of commands, function Name is a symbol and nLocals and nArgs are non-negative integers.)\n7.2.5 Program Elements in the Jack-VM-Hack Platform\n  We end the first part of the VM specification with a top-down view of all the program elements that emerge from the full compilation of a typical high-level program. At the top of figure 7.8 we see a Jack program, consisting of two classes (Jack, a simple Java-like language, is described in chapter 9). Each Jack class consists of one or more methods. When the Jack compiler is applied to a directory that includes n class files, it produces n VM files (in the same directory). Each Jack method xxx within a class Yyy is translated into one VM function called Yyy.xxx within the corresponding VM file.\n\n\n  Figure 7.8 Program elements in the Jack-VM-Hack platform.\n  Next, the figure shows how the VM translator can be applied to the directory in which the VM files reside, generating a single assembly program. This assembly program does two main things. First, it emulates the virtual memory segments of each VM function and file, as well as the implicit stack. Second, it effects the VM commands on the target platform. This is done by manipulating the emulated VM data structures using machine language instructions—those translated from the VM commands. If all works well, that is, if the compiler and the VM translator and the assembler are implemented correctly, the target platform will end up effecting the behavior mandated by the original Jack program.\n7.2.6 VM Programming Examples\n  We end this section by illustrating how the VM abstraction can be used to express typical programming tasks found in high-level programs. We give three examples: (i) a typical arithmetic task, (ii) typical array handling, and (iii) typical object handling. These examples are irrelevant to the VM implementation, and in fact the entire section 7.2.6 can be skipped without losing the thread of the chapter.\n  The main purpose of this section is to illustrate how the compiler developed in chapters 10-11 will use the VM abstraction to translate high-level programs into VM code. Indeed, VM programs are rarely written by human programmers, but rather by compilers. Therefore, it is instructive to begin each example with a high-level code fragment, then show its equivalent representation using VM code. We use a C-style syntax for all the high-level examples.\n  A Typical Arithmetic Task Consider the multiplication algorithm shown at the top of figure 7.9. How should we (or more likely, the compiler) express this algorithm in the VM language? First, high-level structures like for and while must be rewritten using the VM’s simple “goto logic.” In a similar fashion, high-level arithmetic and Boolean operations must be expressed using stack-oriented commands. The resulting code is shown in figure 7.9. (The exact semantics of the VM commands function, label, goto, if- goto, and return are described in chapter 8, but their intuitive meaning is self-explanatory.)\n  Let us focus on the virtual segments depicted at the bottom of figure 7.9. We see that when a VM function starts running, it assumes that (i) the stack is empty, (ii) the argument values on which it is supposed to operate are located in the argument segment, and (iii) the local variables that it is supposed to use are initialized to 0 and located in the local segment.\n  Let us now focus on the VM representation of the algorithm. Recall that VM commands cannot use symbolic argument and variable names—they are limited to making 〈segment index〉 references only. However, the translation from the former to the latter is straightforward. All we have to do is map x, y, sum and j on argument 0, argument 1, local 0 and local 1, respectively, and replace all their symbolic occurrences in the pseudo code with corresponding 〈segment index〉 references.\n  To sum up, when a VM function starts running, it assumes that it is surrounded by a private world, all of its own, consisting of initialized argument and local segments and an empty stack, waiting to be manipulated by its commands. The agent responsible for staging this virtual worldview for every VM function just before it starts running is the VM implementation, as we will see in the next chapter.\n\n\n  Figure 7.9 VM programming example.\n\n\n  Array Handling An array is an indexed collection of objects. Suppose that a high-level program has created an array of ten integers called bar and filled it with some ten numbers. Let us assume that the array’s base has been mapped (behind the scene) on RAM address 4315. Suppose now that the high-level program wants to execute the command bar[2]=19. How can we implement this operation at the VM level?\n  In the C language, such an operation can be also specified as *(bar+2)=19, meaning “set the RAM\nlocation whose address is (bar+2) to 19.” As shown in figure 7.10, this operation lends itself perfectly well to the VM language.\n  It remains to be seen, of course, how a high-level command like bar [2]= 19 is translated in the first place into the VM code shown in figure 7.10. This transformation is described in section 11.1.1, when we discuss the code generation features of the compiler.\n  Object Handling High-level programmers view objects as entities that encapsulate data (organized as fields, or properties) and relevant code (organized as methods). Yet physically speaking, the data of each object instance is serialized on the RAM as a list of numbers representing the object’s field values. Thus the low-level handling of objects is quite similar to that of arrays.\n  For example, consider an animation program designed to juggle some balls on the screen. Suppose that each Ball object is characterized by the integer fields x, y, radius, and color. Let us assume that the program has created one such Ball object and called it b. What will be the internal representation of this object in the computer?\n  Like all other object instances, it will be stored in the RAM. In particular, whenever a program creates a new object, the compiler computes the object’s size in terms of words and the operating system finds and allocates enough RAM space to store it (the exact details of this operation are discussed in chapter 11). For now, let us assume that our b object has been allocated RAM addresses 3012 to 3015, as shown in figure 7.11.\n\n\n  Figure 7.10 VM-based array manipulation using the pointer and that segments.\n  Suppose now that a certain method in the high-level program, say resize, takes a Ball object and an integer r as arguments, and, among other things, sets the ball’s radius to r. The VM representation of this logic is shown in figure 7.11.\n  When we set pointer 0 to the value of argument 0, we are effectively setting the base of the virtual this segment to the object’s base address. From this point on, VM commands can access any field in the object using the virtual memory segment this and an index relative to the object’s base-address in memory.\n  But how did the compiler translate b.radius=17 into the VM code shown in figure 7.11? And how did the compiler know that the radius field of the object corresponds to the third field in its actual representation? We return to these questions in section 11.1.1, when we discuss the code generation features of the compiler.\n"},"chapter07/03-Implementation.html":{"url":"chapter07/03-Implementation.html","title":"3.Implementation","keywords":"","body":"7.3 Implementation\n\n  The virtual machine that was described up to this point is an abstract artifact. If we want to use it for real, we must implement it on a real platform. Building such a VM implementation consists of two conceptual tasks. First, we have to emulate the VM world on the target platform. In particular, each data structure mentioned in the VM specification, namely, the stack and the virtual memory segments, must be represented in some way by the target platform. Second, each VM command must be translated into a series of instructions that effect the command’s semantics on the target platform.\n  This section describes how to implement the VM specification (section 7.2) on the Hack platform. We start by defining a “standard mapping” from VM elements and operations to the Hack hardware and machine language. Next, we suggest guidelines for designing the software that achieves this mapping. In what follows, we will refer to this software using the terms VM implementation or VM translator interchangeably.\n7.3.1 Standard VM Mapping on the Hack Platform, Part I\n  If you reread the virtual machine specification given so far, you will realize that it contains no assumption whatsoever about the architecture on which the VM can be implemented. When it comes to virtual machines, this platform independence is the whole point: You don’t want to commit to any one hardware platform, since you want your machine to potentially run on all of them, including those that were not built yet.\n\n\n  Figure 7.11 VM-based object manipulation using the pointer and this segments.\n  It follows that the VM designer can principally let programmers implement the VM on target platforms in any way they see fit. However, it is usually recommended that some guidelines be provided as to how the VM should map on the target platform, rather than leaving these decisions completely to the implementer’s discretion. These guidelines, called standard mapping, are provided for two reasons. First, they entail a public contract that regulates how VM-based programs can interact with programs produced by compilers that don’t use this VM (e.g., compilers that produce binary code directly). Second, we wish to allow the developers of the VM implementation to run standardized tests, namely, tests that conform to the standard mapping. This way, the tests and the software can be written by different people, which is always recommended. With that in mind, the remainder of this section specifies the standard mapping of the VM on a familiar hardware platform: the Hack computer.\n  VM to Hack Translation Recall that a VM program is a collection of one or more .vm files, each containing one or more VM functions, each being a sequence of VM commands. The VM translator takes a collection of .vm files as input and produces a single Hack assembly language .asm file as output (see figure 7.7). Each VM command is translated by the VM translator into Hack assembly code. The order of the functions within the .vmfiles does not matter.\n  RAM Usage The data memory of the Hack computer consists of 32K 16-bit words. The first 16K serve as general-purpose RAM. The next 16K contain memory maps of I/O devices. The VM implementation should use this space as follows:\n\n\n  Recall that according to the Hack Machine Language Specification, RAM addresses 0 to 15 can be referred to by any assembly program using the symbols R0 to R15, respectively. In addition, the specification states that assembly programs can refer to RAM addresses 0 to 4 (i.e., R0 to R4) using the symbols SP, LCL, ARG, THIS, and THAT. This convention was introduced into the assembly language with foresight, in order to promote readable VM implementations. The expected use of these registers in the VM context is described as follows:\n\n\n  Memory Segments Mapping\n  local, argument, this, that: Each one of these segments is mapped directly on the RAM, and its location is maintained by keeping its physical base address in a dedicated register (LCL, ARG, THIS, and THAT, respectively). Thus any access to the ith entry of any one of these segments should be translated to assembly code that accesses address (base + i) in the RAM, where base is the current value stored in the register dedicated to the respective segment.\n  pointer, temp: These segments are each mapped directly onto a fixed area in the RAM. The pointe segment is mapped on RAM locations 3-4 (also called THIS and THAT) and the temp segment o locations 5-12 (also called R5, R6,..., R12). Thus access to pointer i should be translated to assembl code that accesses RAM location 3 + i, and access to temp i should be translated to assembly code tha accesses RAM location 5 + i.\n  constant: This segment is truly virtual, as it does not occupy any physical space on the target architecture. Instead, the VM implementation handles any VM access to 〈constant i〉 by simply supplying the constant i. static: According to the Hack machine language specification, when a new symbol is encountered for the first time in an assembly program, the assembler allocates a new RAM address to it, starting at address 16. This convention can be exploited to represent each static variable number j in a VM file f as the assembly language symbol f.j. For example, suppose that the file Xxx.vm contains the command push\n  static 3. This command can be translated to the Hack assembly commands@Xxx.3 and D=M, followed by\nadditional assembly code that pushes D’s value to the stack. This implementation of the static segment is\nsomewhat tricky, but it works.\n  Assembly Language Symbols We recap all the assembly language symbols used by VM implementation that conformto the standard mapping.\n\n\n\n\n7.3.2 Design Suggestion forthe VM Implementation\n  The VM translator should accept a single command line parameter, as follows:\nprompt> VMtranslator source\n  Where source is either a file name of the form Xxx.vm(the extension is mandatory) or a directory name containing one or more .vm files (in which case there is no extension). The result of the translation is always a single assembly language file named Xxx.asm, created in the same directory as the input Xxx. The translated code must conformto the standard VM mapping on the Hack platform.\n7.3.3 Program Structure\n  We propose implementing the VM translator using a main program and two modules: parser and code writer.\n  The Parser Module\n  Parser: Handles the parsing of a single .vm file, and encapsulates access to the input code. It reads VM commands, parses them, and provides convenient access to their components. In addition, it removes all white space and comments.\n\n\n\n\n  The Code Writer Module\n  CodeWriter: Translates VM commands into Hack assembly code.\n\n\n  Main Program The main program should construct a Parser to parse the VM input file and a CodeWriter to generate code into the corresponding output file. It should then march through the VM commands in the input file and generate assembly code for each one of them.\n  If the program’s argument is a directory name rather than a file name, the main program should process all the .vm files in this directory. In doing so, it should use a separate Parser for handling each input file and a single CodeWriter for handling the output.\n"},"chapter07/04-Perspective.html":{"url":"chapter07/04-Perspective.html","title":"4.Perspective","keywords":"","body":"7.4 Perspective\n\n  In this chapter we began the process of developing a compiler for a high-level language. Following modern software engineering practices, we have chosen to base the compiler on a two-tier compilation model. In the frontend tier, covered in chapters 10 and 11, the high-level code is translated into an intermediate code, running on a virtual machine. In the backend tier, covered in this and in the next chapter, the intermediate code is translated into the machine language of a target hardware platform (see figures 7.1 and 7.9).\n  The idea of formulating the intermediate code as the explicit language of a virtual machine goes back to the late 1970s, when it was used by several popular Pascal compilers. These compilers generated an intermediate “p-code” that could execute on any computer that implemented it. Following the wide spread use of the World Wide Web in the mid-1990s, cross-platform compatibility became a universally vexing issue. In order to address the problem, the Sun Microsystems company sought to develop a new programming language that could potentially run on any computer and digital device connected to the Internet. The language that emerged from this initiative—Java—is also founded on an intermediate code execution model called the Java Virtual Machine, on JVM.\n  The JVM is a specification that describes an intermediate language called byte-code—the target language of Java compilers. Files written in bytecode are then used for dynamic code distribution of Java programs over the Internet, most notably as applets embedded in web pages. Of course in order to execute these programs, the client computers must be equipped with suitable JVM implementations. These programs, also called Java Run-time Environments (JREs), are widely available for numerous processor/OS combinations, including game consoles and cell phones.\n  In the early 2000s, Microsoft entered the fray with its .NET infrastructure. The centerpiece of .NET is a virtual machine model called Common Language Runtime (CLR). According to the Microsoft vision, many programming languages (including C++, C#, Visual Basic, and J#—a Java variant) could be compiled into intermediate code running on the CLR. This enables code written in different languages to interoperate and share the software libraries of a common run-time environment.\n  We note in closing that a crucial ingredient that must be added to the virtual machine model before its full potential of interoperability is unleashed is a common software library. Indeed the Java virtual machine comes with the standard Java libraries, and the Microsoft virtual machine comes with the Common Language Runtime. These software libraries can be viewed as small operating systems, providing the languages that run on top of the VM with unified services like memory management, GUI utilities, string functions, math functions, and so on. One such library will be described and built in chapter 12.\n"},"chapter07/05-Project.html":{"url":"chapter07/05-Project.html","title":"5.Project","keywords":"","body":"7.5 Project\n\n  This section describes how to build the VM translator presented in the chapter. In the next chapter we will extend this basic translator with additional functionality, leading to a full-scale VM implementation. Before you get started, two comments are in order. First, section 7.2.6 is irrelevant to this project. Second, since the VM translator is designed to generate Hack assembly code, it is recommended to refresh your memory about the Hack assembly language rules (section 4.2).\n  Objective Build the first part of the VM translator (the second part is implemented in Project 8), focusing on the implementation of the stack arithmetic and memory access commands of the VM language.\n  Resources You will need two tools: the programming language in which you will implement your VM translator, and the CPU emulator supplied with the book. This emulator will allow you to execute the machine code generated by your VM translator—an indirect way to test the correctness of the latter. Another tool that may come in handy in this project is the visual VM emulator supplied with the book. This program allows experimenting with a working VM implementation before you set out to build one yourself. For more information about this tool, refer to the VM emulator tutorial.\n  Contract Write a VM-to-Hack translator, conforming to the VM Specification, Part I (section 7.2) and to the Standard VM Mapping on the Hack Platform, Part I (section 7.3.1). Use it to translate the test VM programs supplied here, yielding corresponding programs written in the Hack assembly language. When executed on the supplied CPU emulator, the assembly programs generated by your translator should deliver the results mandated by the supplied test scripts and compare files.\n  Proposed Implementation Stages\n  We recommend building the translator in two stages. This will allow you to unit-test your implementation incrementally, using the test programs supplied here.\n  Stage I: Stack Arithmetic Commands The first version of your VM translator should implement the nine stack arithmetic and logical commands of the VM language as well as the push constant x command (which, among other things, will help in testing the nine former commands). Note that the latter is the generic push command for the special case where the first argument is constant and the second argument is some decimal constant.\n  Stage II: Memory Access Commands The next version of your translator should include a full implementation of the VM language’s push and pop commands, handling all eight memory segments. We suggest breaking this stage into the following substages:\n\nYou have already handled the constant segment.\nNext, handle the segments local, argument, this, and that.\nNext, handle the pointer and temp segments, in particular allowing modification of the bases of the this and that segments.\nFinally, handle the static segment\n\n  Test Programs\n  The five VM programs listed here are designed to unit-test the proposed implementation stages just described.\n  Stage I: Stack Arithmetic\n    ■ SimpleAdd: Pushes and adds two constants\n    ■ StackTest: Executes a sequence of arithmetic and logical operations on the stack.\n  Stage II: Memory Access\n    ■ BasicTest: Executes pop and push operations using the virtual memory segments.\n    ■ PointerTest: Executes pop and push operations using the pointer, this, and that segments.\n    ■ StaticTest: Executes pop and push operations using the static segment.\n    For each program Xxx we supply four files, beginning with the program’s code in Xxx.vm. The XxxVME.tst script allows running the program on the supplied VM emulator, so that you can gain familiarity with the program’s intended operation. After translating the program using your VM translator, the supplied Xxx.tst and Xxx.cmp scripts allow testing the translated assembly code on the CPU emulator\n  Tips\n  Initialization In order for any translated VM program to start running, it must include a preamble startup code that forces the VM implementation to start executing it on the host platform. In addition, in order for any VM code to operate properly, the VM implementation must anchor the base addresses of the virtual segments in selected RAM locations. Both issues—startup code and segments initializations—are implemented in the next project. The difficulty of course is that we need these initializations in place in order to execute the test programs given in this project. The good news is that you should not worry about these issues at all, since the supplied test scripts carry out all the necessary initializations in a manual fashion (for the purpose of this project only).\n  Testing/Debugging For each one of the five test programs, follow these steps:\n\nRun the Xxx.vm program on the supplied VM emulator, using the XxxVME.tst test script, to get acquainted with the intended program’s behavior.\nUse your partial translator to translate the .vm file. The result should be a text file containing a translated .asm program, written in the Hack assembly language.\nInspect the translated .asm program. If there are visible syntax (or any other) errors, debug and fix you translator.\nUse the supplied .tst and .cmp files to run your translated .asm program on the CPU emulator. If there are run-time errors, debug and fix your translator.\n\n  The supplied test programs were carefully planned to test the specific features of each stage in your VM implementation. Therefore, it’s important to implement your translator in the proposed order and to test it using the appropriate test programs at each stage. Implementing a later stage before an early one may cause the test programs to fail.\n\n\n  Figure 7.12 The VM emulator supplied with the book.\n  Tools\n  The VM Emulator The book’s software suite includes a Java-based VM implementation. This VM emulator allows executing VM programs directly, without having to translate them first into machine language. This practice enables experimentation with the VM environment before you set out to implement one yourself. Figure 7.12 is a typical screen shot of the VM emulator in action.\n"},"chapter08/00-Virtual_Machine_II_Program_Control.html":{"url":"chapter08/00-Virtual_Machine_II_Program_Control.html","title":"08. Virtual Machine II: Program Control","keywords":"","body":"Chapter 8: Virtual Machine II: Program Control\n\n\n\n  If everything seems under control, you’re just not going fast enough\n——Mario Andretti (b. 1940), race car champion\n\n\n  Chapter 7 introduced the notion of a virtual machine (VM) and ended with the construction of a basic VM implementation over the Hack platform. In this chapter we continue to develop the VM abstraction, language, and implementation. In particular, we design stack-based mechanisms for handling nested subroutine calls (procedures, functions, methods) of procedural or object-oriented languages. As the chapter progresses, we extend the previously built basic VM implementation, ending with a full-scale VM translator. This translator will serve as the backend of the compiler that we will build in chapters 10 and 11, following the introduction of a high-level object-based language in chapter 9.\n  In any Great Gems in Computer Science contest, stack processing will be a strong finalist. The previous chapter showed how arithmetic and Boolean expressions can be calculated by elementary stack operations. This chapter goes on to show how this remarkably simple data structure can also support remarkably complex tasks like nested subroutine calling, parameter passing, recursion, and the associated memory allocation techniques. Most programmers tend to take these capabilities for granted, expecting the compiler to deliver them, one way or another. We are now in a position to open this black box and see how these fundamental programming mechanisms are actually implemented by a stack-based virtual machine.\n"},"chapter08/01-Background.html":{"url":"chapter08/01-Background.html","title":"1.Background","keywords":"","body":"8.1 Background\n\n  High-level languages allow writing programs in high-level terms. For example,  can be expressed as x=-b+sqrt(power(b,2)-4*a*c), which is almost as descriptive as the real thing. High-level languages support this power of expression through three conventions. First, one is allowed to freely define high-level operations like sqrt and power, as needed. Second, one is allowed to freely use (call) these subroutines as if they were elementary operations like + and *. Third, one is allowed to assume that each called subroutine will get executed—somehow—and that following its termination control will return—somehow—to the next command in one’s code. Flow of control commands take this freedom one step further, allowing writing, say, if ~(a=0) {x=(-b+sqrt(power(b,2)-4*a*c))/ (2*a)} else {x=-c/b}.\n  The ability to compose such expressions freely permits us to write abstract code, closer to the world of algorithmic thought than to that of machine execution. Of course the more abstract the high level, the more work we have to do at the low level. In particular, the low level must manage the delicate interplay between the calling subroutine (the caller) and the called subroutines—the program units that implement system- and user-defined operations like sqrt and power. For each subroutine call during runtime, the low level must handle the following details behind the scene:\n    • Passing parameters fromthe caller to the called subroutine\n    • Saving the state of the caller before switching to execute the called subroutine\n    • Allocating space for the local variables of the called subroutine\n    • Jumping to execute the called subroutine\n    • Returning values fromthe called subroutine back to the caller\n    • Recycling the memory space occupied by the called subroutine, when it returns\n    • Reinstating the state of the caller\n    • Jumping to execute the code of the caller immediately following the spot where we left it\n  Taking care of these housekeeping chores is a major headache, and high-level programmers are fortunate that the compiler relieves them from this duty. So how does the compiler do it? Well, if we choose to base our low level implementation on a stack machine, the job will be surprisingly manageable. In fact, the stack structure lends itself perfectly well to supporting all the housekeeping tasks mentioned above.\n  With that in mind, the remainder of this section describes how program flow and subroutine calling commands can be implemented on a stack machine. We begin with the implementation of program flow commands, which is rather simple and requires no memory management, and continue to describe the more challenging implementation of subroutine calling commands.\n8.1.1 Program Flow\n  The default execution of computer programs is linear, one command after the other. This sequential flow is occasionally broken by branching commands, for example, embarking on a new iteration in a loop. In low-level programming, the branching logic is accomplished by instructing the machine to continue execution at some destination in the program other than the next instruction, using a goto destination command. The destination specification can take several forms, the most primitive being the physical address of the instruction that should be executed next. A slightly more abstract redirection command is established by describing the jump destination using a symbolic label. This variation requires that the language be equipped with some labeling directive, designed to assign symbols to selected points in the code.\n  This basic goto mechanism can easily be altered to effect conditional branching as well. For example, an if-goto destination command can instruct the machine to take the jump only if a given Boolean condition is true; if the condition is false, the regular program flow should continue, executing the next command in the code. How should we introduce the Boolean condition into the language? In a stack machine paradigm, the most natural approach is conditioning the jump on the value of the stack’s topmost element: if it’s not zero, jump to the specified destination; otherwise, execute the next command in the program.\n  In chapter 7 we saw how primitive VM operations can be used to compute any Boolean expression, leaving its truth-value at the stack’s topmost element. This power of expression, combined with the goto and if-goto commands just described, can be used to express any flow of control structure found in any programming language. Two typical examples appear in figure 8.1.\n  The low-level implementation of the VM commands label, goto label, and if-goto label is straightforward. All programming languages, including the “lowest” ones, feature branching commands of some sort. For example, if our low-level implementation is based on translating the VM commands into assembly code, all we have to do is reexpress these goto commands using the branching logic of the assembly language.\n8.1.2 Subroutine Calling\n  Each programming language is characterized by a fixed set of built-in commands. The key abstraction mechanism provided by modern languages is the freedom to extend this basic repertoire with high-level, programmer-defined operations. In procedural languages, the high-level operations are called subroutines, procedures, or functions, and in object-oriented languages they are usually called methods. Throughout this chapter, all these high-level programunits are referred to as subroutines.\n\n\n  Figure 8.1 Low-level flow of control using goto commands.\n  In well-designed programming languages, the use of a high-level operation (implemented by a subroutine) has the same “look and feel” as that of built-in commands. For example, consider the functions add and raise to a power. Most languages feature the former as a built-in operation, while the latter may be written as a subroutine. In spite of these different implementations, both functions should ideally look alike from the caller’s perspective. This would allow the caller to weave the two operations together naturally, yielding consistent and readable code. A stack language implementation of this principle is illustrated in figure 8.2.\n  We see that the only difference between invoking a built-in command and calling a user-defined subroutine is the keyword call preceding the latter. Everything else is exactly the same: Both operations require the caller to set up their arguments, both operations are expected to remove their arguments from the stack, and both operations are expected to return a value which becomes the topmost stack element. The uniformity of this protocol has a subtle elegance that, we hope, is not lost on the reader.\n\n\n  Figure 8.2 Subroutine calling. Elementary commands (like add) and high-level operations (like power) have the same look and feel in terms of argument handling and return values.\n  Subroutines like power usually use local variables for temporary storage. These local variables must be represented in memory during the subroutine’s lifetime, namely, from the point the subroutine starts executing until a return command is encountered. At this point, the memory space occupied by the subroutine’s local variables can be freed. This scheme is complicated by allowing subroutines to be arbitrarily nested: One subroutine may call another subroutine, which may then call another one, and so on. Further, subroutines should be allowed to call themselves recursively; each recursive call must be executed independently of all the other calls and maintain its own set of local and argument variables. How can we implement this nesting mechanismand the memory management tasks implied by it?\n  The property that makes this housekeeping task tractable is the hierarchical nature of the call-and-return logic. Although the subroutine calling chain may be arbitrarily deep as well as recursive, at any given point in time only one subroutine executes at the top of the chain, while all the other subroutines down the calling chain are waiting for it to terminate. This Last-In-First-Out (LIFO) processing model lends itself perfectly well to a stack data structure, which is also LIFO. When subroutine xxx calls subroutine yyy, we can push (save) xxx’s world on the stack and branch to execute yyy. When yyy returns, we can pop (reinstate) xxx’s world off the stack, and continue executing xxx as if nothing happened. This execution model is illustrated in figure 8.3.\n  We use the term frame to refer, conceptually, to the subroutine’s local variables, the arguments on which it operates, its working stack, and the other memory segments that support its operation. In chapter 7, the term stack referred to the working memory that supports operations like pop, push, add, and so on. From now on, when we say stack we mean global stack—-the memory area containing the frames of the current subroutine and all the subroutines waiting for it to return. These two stack notions are closely related, since the working stack of the current subroutine is located at the very tip of the global stack.\n\n\n  Figure 8.3 Subroutine calls and stack states associated with three representative points in the program’s life cycle. All the layers in the stack are waiting for the current layer to complete its execution, at which point the stack becomes shorter and execution resumes at the level just below the current layer. (Following convention, the stack is drawn as if it grows downward.)\n  To recap, the low-level implementation of the call xxx operation entails saving the caller’s frame on the stack, allocating stack space for the local variables of the called subroutine (xxx), then jumping to execute its code. This last “mega jump” is not hard to implement. Since the name of the target subroutine is specified in the call command, the implementation can resolve the symbolic name to a memory address, then jump to execute the code starting at that address. Returning from the called subroutine via a return command is trickier, since the command specifies no return address. Indeed, the caller’s anonymity is inherent in the very notion of a subroutine call. For example, subroutines like power(x,y) or sqrt(x) are designed to serve any caller, implying that the return address cannot be part of their code. Instead, a return command should be interpreted as follows: Redirect the program’s execution to the command following the call command that called the current subroutine, wherever this command may be. The memory location of this command is called return address.\n  A glance at figure 8.3 suggests a stack-based solution to implementing this return logic. When we encounter a call xxx operation, we know exactly what the return address should be: It’s the address of the next command in the caller’s code. Thus, we can push this return address on the stack and proceed to execute the code of the called subroutine. When we later encounter a return command, we can pop the saved return address and simply goto it. In other words, the return address can also be placed in the caller’s frame.\n"},"chapter08/02-VM_Specification_Part_II.html":{"url":"chapter08/02-VM_Specification_Part_II.html","title":"2.VM Specification, Part II","keywords":"","body":"8.2 VM Specification, Part II\n\n  This section extends the basic VM specification from chapter 7 with program flow and function calling commands, thereby completing the overall VM specification.\n8.2.1 Program Flow Commands\n  The VM language features three programflow commands:\n    ■ label label This command labels the current location in the function’s code.\n    Only labeled locations can be jumped to from other parts of the program. The scope of the label is the function in which it is defined. The label is an arbitrary string composed of any sequence of letters, digits, underscore (_), dot (.), and colon (:) that does not begin with a digit.\n    ■ goto label This command effects an unconditional goto operation, causing execution to continue from the location marked by the label. The jump destination must be located in the same function.\n    ■ if-goto label This command effects a conditional goto operation. The stack’s topmost value is popped; if the value is not zero, execution continues from the location marked by the label; otherwise, execution continues from the next command in the program. The jump destination must be located in the same function.\n8.2.2 Function Calling Commands\n  Different high-level languages have different names for program units including functions, procedures, methods, and subroutines. In our overall compilation model (elaborated in chapters 10-11), each such high-level program unit is translated into a low-level program unit called VM function, or simply function.\n  A function has a symbolic name that is used globally to call it. The function name is an arbitrary string composed of any sequence of letters, digits, underscore (_), dot (.), and colon (:) that does not begin with a digit. (We expect that a method bar in class Foo in some high-level language will be translated by the compiler to a VM function named Foo.bar). The scope of the function name is global: All functions in all files are seen by each other and may call each other using the function name.\n  The VM language features three function-related commands:\n    ■ function f n Here starts the code of a function named f that has n local variables;\n    ■ call f m Call function f, stating that m arguments have already been pushed onto the stack by the caller;\n    ■ return Return to the calling function.\n8.2.3 The Function Calling Protocol\n  The events of calling a function and returning from a function can be viewed from two different perspectives: that of the calling function and that of the called function.\n  The calling function view:\n  ■ Before calling the function, the caller must push as many arguments as necessary onto the stack;\n  ■ Next, the caller invokes the function using the call command;\n  ■ After the called function returns, the arguments that the caller has pushed before the call have disappeared fromthe stack, and a return value (that always exists) appears at the top of the stack;\n  ■ After the called function returns, the caller’s memory segments argument, local, static, this, that, and pointer are the same as before the call, and the temp segment is undefined.\n  The called function view:\n  ■ When the called function starts executing, its argument segment has been initialized with actual argument values passed by the caller and its local variables segment has been allocated and initialized to zeros. The static segment that the called function sees has been set to the static segment of the VM file to which it belongs, and the working stack that it sees is empty. The segments this, that, pointer, and temp are undefined upon entry.\n  ■ Before returning, the called function must push a value onto the stack.\n  To repeat an observation made in the previous chapter, we see that when a VM function starts running (or resumes its previous execution), it assumes that it is surrounded by a private world, all of its own, consisting of its memory segments and stack, waiting to be manipulated by its commands. The agent responsible for building this virtual worldview for every VM function is the VM implementation, as we elaborate in section 8.3.\n8.2.4 Initialization\n  A VM program is a collection of related VM functions, typically resulting from the compilation of some high-level program. When the VM implementation starts running (or is reset), the convention is that it always executes an argument-less VM function called Sys.init. Typically, this function then calls the main function in the user’s program. Thus, compilers that generate VM code must ensure that each translated program will have one such Sys.init function.\n"},"chapter08/03-Implementation.html":{"url":"chapter08/03-Implementation.html","title":"3.Implementation","keywords":"","body":"8.3 Implementation\n\n  This section describes how to complete the VM implementation that we started building in chapter 7, leading to a full-scale virtual machine implementation. Section 8.3.1 describes the stack structure that must be maintained, along with its standard mapping over the Hack platform. Section 8.3.2 gives an example, and section 8.3.3 provides design suggestions and a proposed API for actually building the VM implementation.\n  Some of the implementation details are rather technical, and dwelling on them may distract attention from the overall VM operation. This big picture is restored in section 8.3.2, which illustrates the VM implementation in action. Therefore, one may want to consult 8.3.2 for motivation while reading 8.3.1.\n8.3.1 Standard VM Mapping on the Hack Platform, Part II\n  The Global Stack The memory resources of the VM are implemented by maintaining a global stack. Each time a function is called, a new block is added to the global stack. The block consists of the arguments that were set for the called function, a set of pointers used to save the state of the calling function, the local variables of the called function (initialized to 0), and an empty working stack for the called function. Figure 8.4 shows this generic stack structure.\n\n\n  Figure 8.4 The global stack structure.\n  Note that the shaded areas in figure 8.4 as well as the ARG, LCL, and SP pointers are never seen by VM functions. Rather, they are used by the VM implementation to implement the function call-and-return protocol behind the scene.\n  How can we implement this model on the Hack platform? Recall that the standard mapping specifies that the stack should start at RAM address 256, meaning that the VM implementation can start by generating assembly code that sets SP=256. From this point onward, when the VM implementation encounters commands like pop, push, add, and so forth, it can emit assembly code that effects these operations by manipulating SP and relevant words in the host RAM. All this was already done in chapter 7. Likewise, when the VM implementation encounters commands like call, function, and return, it can emit assembly code that maintains the stack structure shown in figure 8.4 on the host RAM. This code is described next.\n  Function Calling Protocol Implementation The function calling protocol and the global stack structure implied by it can be implemented on the Hack platform by effecting (in Hack assembly) the pseudo-code given in figure 8.5.\n  Recall that the VM implementation is a translator program, written in some high-level language. It accepts VM code as input and emits assembly code as output. Hence, each pseudo-operation described in the right column of figure 8.5 is actually implemented by emitting assembly language instructions. Note that some of these “instructions” entail planting label declarations in the generated code stream.\n\n\n  Figure 8.5 VM implementation of function commands. The parenthetical (return address) and (f ) are label declarations, using Hack assembly syntax convention.\n  Assembly Language Symbols As we have seen earlier, the implementation of program flow and function calling commands requires the VM implementation to create and use special symbols at the assembly level. These symbols are summarized in figure 8.6. For completeness of presentation, the first three rows of the table document the symbols described and implemented in chapter 7.\n\n\n  Figure 8.6 All the special assembly symbols prescribed by the VM-on-Hack standard mapping.\n  Bootstrap Code When applied to a VM program (a collection of one or more .vm files), the VM-to-Hack translator produces a single .asm file, written in the Hack assembly language. This file must conform to certain conventions. Specifically, the standard mapping specifies that (i) the VM stack should be mapped on location RAM[256] onward, and (ii) the first VM function that starts executing should be Sys.init (see section 8.2.4).\n  How can we effect this initialization in the .asm file produced by the VM translator? Well, when we built the Hack computer hardware in chapter 5, we wired it in such a way that upon reset, it will fetch and execute the word located in ROM[0]. Thus, the code segment that starts at ROM address 0, called bootstrap code, is the first thing that gets executed when the computer “boots up.” Therefore, in view of the previous paragraph, the computer’s bootstrap code should effect the following operations (in machine language):\n\n\n  Sys.init is then expected to call the main function of the main program and then enter an infinite loop. This action should cause the translated VM programto start running.\n  The notions of “program,” “main program,” and “main function” are compilation-specific and vary from one high-level language to another. For example, in the Jack language, the default is that the first program unit that starts running automatically is the main method of a class named Main. In a similar fashion, when we tell the JVM to execute a given Java class, say Foo, it looks for, and executes, the Foo.main method. Each language compiler can effect such “automatic” startup routines by programming Sys.init appropriately.\n8.3.2 Example\n  The factorial of a positive number n can be computed by the iterative formula n! = 1 ·2·... ·(n - 1) · n. This algorithmis implemented in figure 8.7.\n  Let us focus on the call mult command highlighted in the fact function code from figure 8.7. Figure 8.8shows three stack states related to this call, illustrating the function calling protocol in action.\n  If we ignore the middle stack instance in figure 8.8, we observe that fact has set up some arguments and called mult to operate on them(left stack instance). When mult returns (right stack instance), the arguments of the called function have been replaced with the function’s return value. In other words, when the dust clears from the function call, the calling function has received the service that it has requested, and processing resumes as if nothing happened: The drama of mult’s processing (middle stack instance) has left no trace whatsoever on the stack, except for the return value.\n\n\n  Figure 8.7 The life cycle of function calls. An arbitrary function p calls function fact, which then calls mult several times. Vertical arrows depict transfer of control from one function to another. At any given point in time, only one function is running, while all the functions up the calling chain are waiting for it to return. When a function returns, the function that called it resumes its execution.\n\n\n  Figure 8.8 Global stack dynamics corresponding to figure 8.7, focusing on the call mult event. The pointers SP, ARG, and LCL are not part of the VM abstraction and are used by the VM implementation to map the stack on the host RAM.\n8.3.3 Design Suggestions for the VM Implementation\n  The basic VM translator built in Project 7 was based on two modules: parser and code writer. This translator can be extended into a full-scale VM implementation by extending these modules with the functionality described here.\n  The Parser Module If the basic parser that you built in Project 7 does not already parse the six VM commands specified in this chapter, then add their parsing now. Specifically, make sure that the commandType method developed in Project 7 also returns the constants corresponding to the six VM commands described in this chapter: C_LABEL, C_GOTO, C_IF, C_FUNCTION, C_RETURN, and C_CALL.\n  The CodeWriter Module The basic CodeWriter specified in chapter 7 should be augmented with the following methods.\n  CodeWriter: Translates VM commands into Hack assembly code. The routines listed here should be added to the CodeWriter module API given in chapter 7.\n\n\n\n"},"chapter08/04-Perspective.html":{"url":"chapter08/04-Perspective.html","title":"4.Perspective","keywords":"","body":"8.4 Perspective\n\n  The notions of subroutine calling and program flow are fundamental to all high-level languages. This means that somewhere down the translation path to binary code, someone must take care of the intricate housekeeping chores related to their implementation. In Java, C#, and Jack, this burden falls on the VM level. And if the VM is stack-based, it lends itself nicely to the job, as we have seen throughout this chapter. In general then, virtual machines that implement subroutine calls and recursion as a primitive feature deliver a significant and useful abstraction.\n  Of course this is just one implementation option. Some compilers handle the details of subroutine calling directly, without using a VM at all. Other compilers use various forms of VMs, but not necessarily for managing subroutine calling. Finally, in some architectures most of the subroutine calling functionality is handled directly by the hardware.\n  In the next two chapters we will develop a Jack-to-VM compiler. Since the back-end of this compiler was already developed—it is the VM implementation built in chapters 7-8—the compiler’s development will be a relatively easy task.\n"},"chapter08/05-Project.html":{"url":"chapter08/05-Project.html","title":"5.Project","keywords":"","body":"8.5 Project\n\n  Objective Extend the basic VM translator built in Project 7 into a full-scale VM translator. In particular, add the ability to handle the programflow and function calling commands of the VM language.\n  Resources (same as Project 7) You will need two tools: the programming language in which you will implement your VM translator, and the CPU emulator supplied with the book. This emulator will allow you to execute the machine code generated by your VM translator—an indirect way to test the correctness of the latter. Another tool that may come in handy in this project is the visual VM emulator supplied with the book. This program allows experimenting with a working VM implementation before you set out to build one yourself. For more information about this tool, refer to the VM emulator tutorial.\n  Contract Write a full-scale VM-to-Hack translator, extending the translator developed in Project 7, and conforming to the VM Specification, Part II (section 8.2) and to the Standard VM Mapping on the Hack Platform (section 8.3.1). Use it to translate the VM programs supplied below, yielding corresponding programs written in the Hack assembly language. When executed on the supplied CPU emulator, these assembly programs should deliver the results mandated by the supplied test scripts and compare files.\n  Testing Programs\n  We recommend completing the implementation of the translator in two stages. First implement the program flow commands, then the function calling commands. This will allow you to unit-test your implementation incrementally, using the test programs supplied here.\n  For each program Xxx, the XxxVME.tst script allows running the program on the supplied VM emulator, so that you can gain familiarity with the program’s intended operation. After translating the program using your VM translator, the supplied Xxx.tst and Xxx.cmp scripts allow testing the translated assembly code on the CPU emulator.\n  Test Programs for Program Flow Commands\n    ■ BasicLoop: computes 1 + 2 + ··· + n and pushes the result onto the stack. This program tests the implementation of the VM language’s goto and if-goto commands.\n    ■ Fibonacci: computes and stores in memory the first n elements of the Fibonacci series. This typical array manipulation programprovides a more challenging test of the VM’s branching commands.\n  Test Programs for Function Calling Commands\n    ■ SimpleFunction: performs a simple calculation and returns the result. This program provides a basic test of the implementation of the function and return commands.\n    ■ FibonacciElement: This program provides a full test of the implementation of the VM’s function calling commands, the bootstrap section, and most of the other VM commands.\n    The programdirectory consists of two .vm files:\n    ● Main.vm contains one function called fibonacci. This recursive function returns the n-th element of the Fibonacci series;\n    ● Sys.vm contains one function called init. This function calls the Main.fibonacci function with n = 4, then loops infinitely.\n    Since the overall program consists of two .vm files, the entire directory must be compiled in order to produce a single FibonacciElement.asm file. (compiling each ● vm file separately will yield two separate .asm files, which is not desired here).\n    ■ StaticsTest: A full test of the VM implementation’s handling of static variables. Consists of two .vm files, each representing the compilation of a stand-alone class file, plus a Sys.vm file. The entire directory should be compiled in order to produce a single StaticsTest.asm file.\n    (Recall that according to the VM Specification, the bootstrap code generated by the VM implementation must include a call to the Sys.init function).\n  Tips\n  Initialization In order for any translated VM program to start running, it must include a preamble startup code that forces the VM implementation to start executing it on the host platform. In addition, in order for any VM code to operate properly, the VM implementation must store the base addresses of the virtual segments in selected locations in the host RAM. The first three test programs in this project assume that the startup code was not yet implemented and include test scripts that effect the necessary initializations “manually.” The last two programs assume that the startup code is already part of the VM implementation.\n  Testing/Debugging For each one of the five test programs, follow these steps:\n\nRun the program on the supplied VM emulator, using the XxxVME.tst test script, to get acquainted with the intended program’s behavior.\nUse your partial translator to translate the .vm file(s), yielding a single .asm text file that contains a translated programwritten in the Hack assembly language.\nInspect the translated .asm program. If there are visible syntax (or any other) errors, debug and fix your translator.\nUse the supplied .tst and .cmp files to run your translated .asm program on the CPU emulator. If there are run-time errors, debug and fix your translator.\n\n  Note: The supplied test programs were carefully planned to unit-test the specific features of each stage in your VM implementation. Therefore, it’s important to implement your translator in the proposed order and to test it using the appropriate test programs at each stage. Implementing a later stage before an early one may cause the test programs to fail.\n  Tools Same as in Project 7.\n"},"chapter09/00-High-Level_Language.html":{"url":"chapter09/00-High-Level_Language.html","title":"09.
