forget; What I see, I remember; What I do, I understand.\n——Confucius, 551-479 BC\n\n\n  Once upon a time, every computer specialist had a gestalt understanding of how computers worked. The overall interactions among hardware, software, compilers, and the operating system were simple and transparent enough to produce a coherent picture of the computer’s operations. As modern computer technologies have become increasingly more complex, this clarity is all but lost: the most fundamental ideas and techniques in computer science—the very essence of the field—are now hidden under many layers of obscure interfaces and proprietary implementations. An inevitable consequence of this complexity has been specialization, leading to computer science curricula of many courses, each covering a single aspect of the field.\n  We wrote this book because we felt that many computer science students are missing the forest for the trees. The typical student is marshaled through a series of courses in programming, theory, and engineering, without pausing to appreciate the beauty of the picture at large. And the picture at large is such that hardware and software systems are tightly interrelated through a hidden web of abstractions, interfaces, and contract-based implementations. Failure to see this intricate enterprise in the flesh leaves many students and professionals with an uneasy feeling that, well, they don’t fully understand what’s going on inside computers.\n  We believe that the best way to understand how computers work is to build one from scratch. With that in mind, we came up with the following concept. Let’s specify a simple but sufficiently powerful computer system, and have the students build its hardware platform and software hierarchy from the ground up, starting with nothing more than elementary logic gates. And while we are at it, let’s do it right. We say this because building a general-purpose computer from first principles is a huge undertaking. Therefore, we identified a unique educational opportunity not only to build the thing, but also to illustrate, in a hands-on fashion, how to effectively plan and manage large-scale hardware and software development projects. In addition, we sought to demonstrate the ability to construct, through recursive ascent and human reasoning, fantastically complex and useful systems from nothing more than a few primitive building blocks.\n"},"chapter01/00-Boolean_Logic.html":{"url":"chapter01/00-Boolean_Logic.html","title":"01. Boolean Logic","keywords":"","body":"Chapter 1: Boolean Logic\n\n  Every digital device—be it a personal computer, a cellular telephone, or a network router—is based on a set of chips designed to store and process information. Although these chips come in different shapes and forms, they are all made from the same building blocks: Elementary logic gates. The gates can be physically implemented in many different materials and fabrication technologies, but their logical behavior is consistent across all computers. In this chapter we start out with one primitive logic gate--Nand--and build all the other logic gates from it. The result is a rather standard set of gates, which will be later used to construct our computer’s processing and storage chips. This will be done in chapters 2 and 3, respectively.\n  All the hardware chapters in the book, beginning with this one, have the same structure. Each chapter focuses on a well-defined task, designed to construct or integrate a certain family of chips. The prerequisite knowledge needed to approach this task is provided in a brief Background section. The next section provides a complete Specification of the chips’ abstractions, namely, the various services that they should deliver, one way or another. Having presented the what, a subsequent Implementation section proposes guidelines and hints about how the chips can be actually implemented. A Perspective section rounds up the chapter with concluding comments about important topics that were left out from the discussion. Each chapter ends with a technical Project section. This section gives step-by-step instructions for actually building the chips on a personal computer, using the hardware simulator supplied with the book.\n  This being the first hardware chapter in the book, the Background section is somewhat lengthy, featuring a special section on hardware description and simulation tools.\n"},"chapter01/01-Background.html":{"url":"chapter01/01-Background.html","title":"1.Background","keywords":"","body":"1.1 Background\n\n  This chapter focuses on the construction of a family of simple chips called Boolean gates. Since Boolean gates are physical implementations of Boolean functions, we start with a brief treatment of Boolean algebra. We then show how Boolean gates implementing simple Boolean functions can be interconnected to deliver the functionality of more complex chips. We conclude the background section with a description of how hardware design is actually done in practice, using software simulation tools.\n1.1.1 BooleanAlgebra\n  Boolean algebra deals with Boolean (also called binary) values that are typically labeled true/false, 1/0, yes/no, on/off, and so forth. We will use 1 and 0. A Boolean function is a function that operates on binary inputs and returns binary outputs. Since computer hardware is based on the representation and manipulation of binary values, Boolean functions play a central role in the specification, construction, and optimization of hardware architectures. Hence, the ability to formulate and analyze Boolean functions is the first step toward constructing computer architectures.\n  Truth Table Representation The simplest way to specify a Boolean function is to enumerate all the possible values of the function’s input variables, along with the function’s output for each set of inputs. This is called the truth table representation of the function, illustrated in figure 1.1.\n  The first three columns of figure 1.1 enumerate all the possible binary values of the function’s variables. For each one of the 2^n possible tuples υ1...υn(here n = 3), the last column gives the value of f(υ1...υn).\n  Boolean Expressions In addition to the truth table specification, a Boolean function can also be specified using Boolean operations over its input variables. The basic Boolean operators that are typically used are “And” (x And y is 1 exactly when both x and y are 1) “Or” (x Or y is 1 exactly when either x or y or both are 1), and “Not” (Not x is 1 exactly when x is 0). We will use a common arithmetic-like notation for these operations: x · y (or xy) means x And y, x + y means x Or y, and means Not x.\n  To illustrate, the function defined in figure 1.1 is equivalently given by the Boolean expression f(x, y, z) = (x + y) · z. For example, let us evaluate this expression on the inputs x = 0, y = 1, z = 0 (third row in the table). Since y is 1, it follows that x + y = 1 and thus 0. The complete verification of the equivalence between the expression and the truth table is achieved by evaluating the expression on each of the eight possible input combinations, verifying that it yields the same value listed in the table’s right column.\n\n\n  Figure 1.1 Truth table representation of a Boolean function (example).\n  Canonical Representation As it turns out, every Boolean function can be expressed using at least one Boolean expression called the canonical representation. Starting with the function’s truth table, we focus on all the rows in which the function has value 1. For each such row, we construct a termcreated byAnding together literals (variables or their negations) that fix the values of all the row’s inputs. For example, let us focus on the third row in figure 1.1, where the function’s value is 1. Since the variable values in this row are x = 0, y = 1, z = 0, we construct the term xyz. Following the same procedure, we construct the terms xyz and xyz for rows 5 and 7. Now, if we Or-together all these terms (for all the rows where the function has value 1), we get a Boolean expression that is equivalent to the given truth table. Thus the canonical representation of the Boolean function shown in figure 1.1 is f(x, y, z) = xyz + xyz + xyz. This construction leads to an important conclusion: Every Boolean function, no matter how complex, can be expressed using three Boolean operators only: And, Or, and Not.\n  Two-Input Boolean Functions An inspection of figure 1.1 reveals that the number of Boolean functions that can be defined over n binary variables is 2^2^n. For example, the sixteen Boolean functions spanned by two variables are listed in figure 1.2. These functions were constructed systematically, by enumerating all the possible 4-wise combinations of binary values in the four right columns. Each function has a conventional name that seeks to describe its underlying operation. Here are some examples: The name of the Nor function is shorthand for Not-Or: Take the Or of x and y, then negate the result. The Xor function——shorthand for “exclusive or”——returns 1 when its two variables have opposing truth-values and 0 otherwise. Conversely, the Equivalence function returns 1 when the two variables have identical truthvalues. The If-x-then-y function (also known as x → y, or “x Implies y”) returns 1 when x is 0 or when both x and y are 1. The other functions are self-explanatory.\n\n\n  Figure 1.2 All the Boolean functions of two variables.\n  The Nand function (as well as the Nor function) has an interesting theoretical property: Each one of the operations And, Or, and Not can be constructed from it, and it alone (e.g., x Or y = (x Nand x) Nand (y Nand y). And since every Boolean function can be constructed fromAnd, Or, and Not operations using the canonical representation method, it follows that every Boolean function can be constructed from Nand operations alone. This result has far-reaching practical implications: Once we have in our disposal a physical device that implements Nand, we can use many copies of this device (wired in a certain way) to implement in hardware any Boolean function.\n1.1.2 Gate Logic\n  A gate is a physical device that implements a Boolean function. If a Boolean function f operates on n variables and returns m binary results (in all our examples so far, m was 1), the gate that implements f will have n input pins and m output pins. When we put some values v1...vn in the gate’s input pins, the gate’s “logic”——its internal structure——should compute and output f(υ1...υn). And just like complex Boolean functions can be expressed in terms of simpler functions, complex gates are composed frommore elementary gates. The simplest gates of all are made from tiny switching devices, called transistors, wired in a certain topology designed to effect the overall gate functionality.\n  Although most digital computers today use electricity to represent and transmit binary data from one gate to another, any alternative technology permitting switching and conducting capabilities can be employed. Indeed, during the last fifty years, researchers have built many hardware implementations of Boolean functions, including magnetic, optical, biological, hydraulic, and pneumatic mechanisms. Today, most gates are implemented as transistors etched in silicon, packaged as chips. In this book we use the words chip and gate interchangeably, tending to use the termgates for simple chips.\n  The availability of alternative switching technology options, on the one hand, and the observation that Boolean algebra can be used to abstract the behavior of any such technology, on the other, is extremely important. Basically, it implies that computer scientists don’t have to worry about physical things like electricity, circuits, switches, relays, and power supply. Instead, computer scientists can be content with the abstract notions of Boolean algebra and gate logic, trusting that someone else (the physicists and electrical engineers—bless their souls) will figure out how to actually realize themin hardware. Hence, a primitive gate (see figure 1.3) can be viewed as a black box device that implements an elementary logical operation in one way or another—we don’t care how. A hardware designer starts from such primitive gates and designs more complicated functionality by interconnecting them, leading to the construction of composite gates.\n\n\n  Figure 1.3 Standard symbolic notation of some elementary logic gates.\n\n\n  Figure 1.4 Composite implementation of a three-way And gate. The rectangle on the right defines the conceptual boundaries of the gate interface.\n  Primitive and Composite Gates Since all logic gates have the same input and output semantics (0’s and 1’s), they can be chained together, creating composite gates of arbitrary complexity. For example, suppose we are asked to implement the 3-way Boolean function And(a, b, c). Using Boolean algebra, we can begin by observing that a·b·c = (a·b)·c, or, using prefix notation, And(a, b, c) = And(And(a, b), c). Next, we can use this result to construct the composite gate depicted in figure 1.4.\n  The construction described in figure 1.4 is a simple example of gate logic, also called logic design. Simply put, logic design is the art of interconnecting gates in order to implement more complex functionality, leading to the notion of composite gates. Since composite gates are themselves realizations of (possibly complex) Boolean functions, their “outside appearance” (e.g., left side of figure 1.4) looks just like that of primitive gates. At the same time, their internal structure can be rather complex.\n  We see that any given logic gate can be viewed from two different perspectives: external and internal. The right-hand side of figure 1.4 gives the gate’s internal architecture, or implementation, whereas the left side shows only the gate interface, namely, the input and output pins that it exposes to the outside world. The former is relevant only to the gate designer, whereas the latter is the right level of detail for other designers who wish to use the gate as an abstract off-the-shelf component, without paying attention to its internal structure.\n  Let us consider another logic design example—that of a Xor gate. As discussed before, Xor(a, b) is 1 exactly when either a is 1 and b is 0, or when a is 0 and b is 1. Said otherwise, Xor(a, b) = Or(And(a, Not(b)), And(Not(a), b)). This definition leads to the logic design shown in figure 1.5.\n  Note that the gate interface is unique: There is only one way to describe it, and this is normally done using a truth table, a Boolean expression, or some verbal specifica-tion. This interface, however, can be realized using many different implementations, some of which will be better than others in terms of cost, speed, and simplicity. For example, the Xor function can be implemented using four, rather than five, And, Or, and Not gates. Thus, from a functional standpoint, the fundamental requirement of logic design is that the gate implementation will realize its stated interface, in one way or another. From an efficiency standpoint, the general rule is to try to do more with less, that is, use as few gates as possible.\n\n\n  Figure 1.5 Xor gate, along with a possible implementation.\n  To sum up, the art of logic design can be described as follows: Given a gate specification (interface), find an efficient way to implement it using other gates that were already implemented. This, in a nutshell, is what we will do in the rest of this chapter.\n1.1.3 Actual Hardware Construction\n  Having described the logic of composing complex gates from simpler ones, we are now in a position to discuss how gates are actually built. Let us start with an intentionally naïve example.\n  Suppose we open a chip fabrication shop in our home garage. Our first contract is to build a hundred Xor gates. Using the order’s downpayment, we purchase a soldering gun, a roll of copper wire, and three bins labeled “And gates,” “Or gates,” and “Not gates,” each containing many identical copies of these elementary logic gates. Each of these gates is sealed in a plastic casing that exposes some input and output pins, as well as a power supply plug. To get started, we pin figure 1.5 to our garage wall and proceed to realize it using our hardware. First, we take two And gates, two Not gates, and one Or gate, and mount them on a board according to the figure’s layout. Next, we connect the chips to one another by running copper wires among them and by soldering the wire ends to the respective input/output pins. Now, if we follow the gate diagram carefully, we will end up having three exposed wire ends. We then solder a pin to each one of these wire ends, seal the entire device (except for the three pins) in a plastic casing, and label it “Xor.” We can repeat this assembly process many times over. At the end of the day, we can store all the chips that we’ve built in a new bin and label it “Xor gates.” If we (or other people) are asked to construct some other chips in the future, we’ll be able to use these Xor gates as elementary building blocks, just as we used the And, Or, and Not gates before.\n  As the reader has probably sensed, the garage approach to chip production leaves much to be desired. For starters, there is no guarantee that the given chip diagram is correct. Although we can prove correctness in simple cases like Xor, we cannot do so in many realistically complex chips. Thus, we must settle for empirical testing: Build the chip, connect it to a power supply, activate and deactivate the input pins in various configurations, and hope that the chip outputs will agree with its specifications. If the chip fails to deliver the desired outputs, we will have to tinker with its physical structure—a rather messy affair. Further, even if we will come up with the right design, replicating the chip assembly process many times over will be a time-consuming and error-prone affair. There must be a better way!\n1.1.4 Hardware Description Language (HDL)\n  Today, hardware designers no longer build anything with their bare hands. Instead, they plan and optimize the chip architecture on a computer workstation, using structured modeling formalisms like Hardware Description Language, or HDL (also known as VHDL, where V stands for Virtual). The designer specifies the chip structure by writing an HDL program, which is then subjected to a rigorous battery of tests. These tests are carried out virtually, using computer simulation: A special software tool, called a hardware simulator, takes the HDL program as input and builds an image of the modeled chip in memory. Next, the designer can instruct the simulator to test the virtual chip on various sets of inputs, generating simulated chip outputs. The outputs can then be compared to the desired results, as mandated by the client who ordered the chip built.\n  In addition to testing the chip’s correctness, the hardware designer will typically be interested in a variety of parameters such as speed of computation, energy consumption, and the overall cost implied by the chip design. All these parameters can be simulated and quantified by the hardware simulator, helping the designer optimize the design until the simulated chip delivers desired cost/performance levels.\n  Thus, using HDL, one can completely plan, debug, and optimize the entire chip before a single penny is spent on actual production. When the HDL program is deemed complete, that is, when the performance of the simulated chip satisfies the client who ordered it, the HDL program can become the blueprint from which many copies of the physical chip can be stamped in silicon. This final step in the chip life cycle——from an optimized HDL program to mass production——is typically out-sourced to companies that specialize in chip fabrication, using one switching technology or another.\n  Example: Building a XorGate As we have seen in figures 1.2 and 1.5, one way to define exclusive or is Xor(a, b) = Or(And(a, Not(b)), And(Not(a), b)). This logic can be expressed either graphically, as a gate diagram, or textually, as an HDL program. The latter program is written in the HDL variant used throughout this book, defined in appendix A. See figure 1.6 for the details.\n  Explanation An HDL definition of a chip consists of a header section and a parts section. The header section specifies the chip interface, namely the chip name and the names of its input and output pins. The parts section describes the names and topology of all the lower-level parts (other chips) from which this chip is constructed. Each part is represented by a statement that specifies the part name and the way it is connected to other parts in the design. Note that in order to write such statements legibly, the HDL programmer must have a complete documentation of the underlying parts’ interfaces. For example, figure 1.6 assumes that the input and output pins of the Not gate are labeled in and out, and those of And and Or are labeled a, b and out. This API-type information is not obvious, and one must have access to it before one can plug the chip parts into the present code.\n  Inter-part connections are described by creating and connecting internal pins, as needed. For example, consider the bottom of the gate diagram, where the output of a Not gate is piped into the input of a subsequent And gate. The HDL code describes this connection by the pair of statements Not(...,out=nota) and And(a=nota,...). The first statement creates an internal pin (outbound wire) named nota, feeding out into it. The second statement feeds the value of nota into the a input of an And gate. Note that pins may have an unlimited fan out. For example, in figure 1.6, each input is simultaneously fed into two gates. In gate diagrams, multiple connections are described using forks. In HDL, the existence of forks is implied by the code.\n\n\n  Figure 1.6 HDL implementation of a Xor gate.\n  Testing Rigorous quality assurance mandates that chips be tested in a specific, replicable, and welldocumented fashion. With that in mind, hardware simulators are usually designed to run test scripts, written in some scripting language. For example, the test script in figure 1.6 is written in the scripting language understood by the hardware simulator supplied with the book. This scripting language is described fully in appendix B.\n  Let us give a brief description of the test script from figure 1.6. The first two lines of the test script instruct the simulator to load the Xor.hdl program and get ready to print the values of selected variables. Next, the script lists a series of testing scenarios, designed to simulate the various contingencies under which the Xor chip will have to operate in “real-life” situations. In each scenario, the script instructs the simulator to bind the chip inputs to certain data values, compute the resulting output, and record the test results in a designated output file. In the case of simple gates like Xor, one can write an exhaustive test script that enumerates all the possible input values of the gate. The resulting output file (right side of figure 1.6) can then be viewed as a complete empirical proof that the chip is well designed. The luxury of such certitude is not feasible in more complex chips, as we will see later.\n1.1.5 Hardware Simulation\n  Since HDL is a hardware construction language, the process of writing and debugging HDL programs is quite similar to software development. The main difference is that instead of writing code in a language like Java, we write it in HDL, and instead of using a compiler to translate and test the code, we use a hardware simulator. The hardware simulator is a computer programthat knows how to parse and interpret HDL code, turn it into an executable representation, and test it according to the specifications of a given test script. There exist many commercial hardware simulators on the market, and these vary greatly in terms of cost, complexity, and ease of use. Together with this book we provide a simple (and free!) hardware simulator that is sufficiently powerful to support sophisticated hardware design projects. In particular, the simulator provides all the necessary tools for building, testing, and integrating all the chips presented in the book, leading to the construction of a general-purpose computer. Figure 1.7 illustrates a typical chip simulation session.\n"},"chapter01/02-Specification.html":{"url":"chapter01/02-Specification.html","title":"2.Specification","keywords":"","body":"1.2 Specification\n\n  This section specifies a typical set of gates, each designed to carry out a common Boolean operation. These gates will be used in the chapters that follow to construct the full architecture of a typical modern computer. Our starting point is a single primitive Nand gate, from which all other gates will be derived recursively. Note that we provide only the gates’ specifications, or interfaces, delaying implementation details until a subsequent section. Readers who wish to construct the specified gates in HDL are encouraged to do so, referring to appendix A as needed. All the gates can be built and simulated on a personal computer, using the hardware simulator supplied with the book.\n\n\n  Figure 1.7 A screen shot of simulating an Xor chip on the hardware simulator. The simulator state i shown just after the test script has completed running. The pin values correspond to the last simulatio step (a = b = 1). Note that the output file generated by the simulation is consistent with the Xor truth table indicating that the loaded HDL program delivers a correct Xor functionality. The compare file, not show in the figure and typically specified by the chip’s client, has exactly the same structure and contents as tha of the output file. The fact that the two files agree with each other is evident from the status messag displayed at the bottomof the screen.\n1.2.1 The NandGate\n  The starting point of our computer architecture is the Nand gate, from which all other gates and chips are built. The Nand gate is designed to compute the following Boolean function:\n\n\n  Throughout the book, we use “chip API boxes” to specify chips. For each chip, the API specifies the chip name, the names of its input and output pins, the function or operation that the chip effects, and an optional comment.\n\n\n\n1.2.2 Basic Logic Gates\n  Some of the logic gates presented here are typically referred to as “elementary” or “basic.” At the same time, every one of them can be composed from Nand gates alone. Therefore, they need not be viewed as primitive.\n  Not The single-input Not gate, also known as “converter,” converts its input from 0 to 1 and vice versa. The gate API is as follows:\n\n\n  And The And function returns 1 when both its inputs are 1, and 0 otherwise.\n\n\n  Or The Or function returns 1 when at least one of its inputs is 1, and 0 otherwise.\n\n\n  Xor The Xor function, also known as “exclusive or,” returns 1 when its two inputs have opposing values, and 0 otherwise.\n\n\n  Multiplexor A multiplexor (figure 1.8) is a three-input gate that uses one of the inputs, called “selectio bit,” to select and output one of the other two inputs, called “data bits.” Thus, a better name for thi device might have been selector. The name multiplexor was adopted from communications systems where similar devices are used to serialize (multiplex) several input signals over a single output wire.\n\n\n\n\n  Figure 1.8 Multiplexor. The table at the top right is an abbreviated version of the truth table on the left.\n\n\n  Figure 1.9 Demultiplexor.\n\n\n\n\n1.2.3 Multi-Bit Versions of Basic Gates\n  Computer hardware is typically designed to operate on multi-bit arrays called “buses.” For example, a basic requirement of a 32-bit computer is to be able to compute (bit-wise) an And function on two given 32-bit buses. To implement this operation, we can build an array of 32 binary And gates, each operating separately on a pair of bits. In order to enclose all this logic in one package, we can encapsulate the gates array in a single chip interface consisting of two 32-bit input buses and one 32-bit output bus.\n  This section describes a typical set of such multi-bit logic gates, as needed for the construction of a typical 16-bit computer. We note in passing that the architecture of n-bit logic gates is basically the same irrespective of n’s value.\n  When referring to individual bits in a bus, it is common to use an array syntax. For example, to refer to individual bits in a 16-bit bus named data, we use the notation data [0], data [1],..., data[15].\n  Multi-Bit Not An n-bit Not gate applies the Boolean operation Not to every one of the bits in its n-bit input bus:\n\n\n  Multi-Bit And An n-bit And gate applies the Boolean operation And to every one of the n bit-pairs arrayed in its two n-bit input buses:\n\n\n  Multi-Bit Or An n-bit Or gate applies the Boolean operation Or to every one of the n bit-pairs arrayed in its two n-bit input buses:\n\n\n  Multi-Bit Multiplexor An n-bit multiplexor is exactly the same as the binary multiplexor described in figure 1.8, except that the two inputs are each n-bit wide; the selector is a single bit.\n\n\n\n\n1.2.4 Multi-Way Versions of Basic Gates\n  Many 2-way logic gates that accept two inputs have natural generalization to multi-way variants that accept an arbitrary number of inputs. This section describes a set of multi-way gates that will be used subsequently in various chips in our computer architecture. Similar generalizations can be developed for other architectures, as needed.\n  Multi-Way Or An n-way Or gate outputs 1 when at least one of its n bit inputs is 1, and 0 otherwise. Here is the 8-way variant of this gate:\n\n\n  Multi-Way/Multi-Bit Multiplexor An m-way n-bit multiplexor selects one of m n-bit input buses and outputs it to a single n-bit output bus. The selection is specified by a set of k control bits, where k = log2m. Figure 1.10 depicts a typical example.\n  The computer platform that we develop in this book requires two variations of this chip: A 4-way 16-bit multiplexor and an 8-way 16-bit multiplexor:\n\n\n  Figure 1.10 4-way multiplexor. The width of the input and output buses may vary.\n\n\n\n  Multi-Way/Multi-Bit Demultiplexor An m-way n-bit demultiplexor (figure 1.11) channels a single n-bit input into one of m possible n-bit outputs. The selection is specified by a set of k control bits, where k = log2m.\n  The specific computer platform that we will build requires two variations of this chip: A 4-way 1-bit demultiplexor and an 8-way 1-bit multiplexor, as follows.\n\n\n  Figure 1.11 4-way demultiplexor.\n\n\n"},"chapter01/03-Implementation.html":{"url":"chapter01/03-Implementation.html","title":"3.Implementation","keywords":"","body":"1.3 Implementation\n\n  Similar to the role of axioms in mathematics, primitive gates provide a set of elementary building blocks from which everything else can be built. Operationally, primitive gates have an “off-the-shelf” implementation that is supplied externally. Thus, they can be used in the construction of other gates and chips without worrying about their internal design. In the computer architecture that we are now beginning to build, we have chosen to base all the hardware on one primitive gate only: Nand. We now turn to outlining the first stage of this bottom-up hardware construction project, one gate at a time.\n  Our implementation guidelines are intentionally partial, since we want you to discover the actual gate architectures yourself. We reiterate that each gate can be implemented in more than one way; the simpler the implementation, the better.\n  Not: The implementation of a unary Not gate froma binary Nand gate is simple. Tip: Think positive.\n  And: Once again, the gate implementation is simple. Tip: Think negative.\n  Or/Xor: These functions can be defined in terms of some of the Boolean functions implemented previously, using some simple Boolean manipulations. Thus, the respective gates can be built using previously built gates.\n  Multiplexor/ Demultiplexor: Likewise, these gates can be built using previously built gates.\n  Multi-Bit Not/And/Or Gates: Since we already know how to implement the elementary versions of these gates, the implementation of their n-ary versions is simply a matter of constructing arrays of n elementary gates, having each gate operate separately on its bit inputs. This implementation task is rather boring, but it will carry its weight when these multi-bit gates are used in more complex chips, as described in subsequent chapters.\n  Multi-Bit Multiplexor: The implementation of an n-ary multiplexor is simply a matter of feeding the same selection bit to every one of n binary multiplexors. Again, a boring task resulting in a very useful chip.\n  Multi-Way Gates: Implementation tip: Think forks.\n"},"chapter01/04-Perspective.html":{"url":"chapter01/04-Perspective.html","title":"4.Perspective","keywords":"","body":"1.4 Perspective\n\n  This chapter described the first steps taken in an applied digital design project. In the next chapter we will build more complicated functionality using the gates built here. Although we have chosen to use Nand as our basic building block, other approaches are possible. For example, one can build a complete computer platform using Nor gates alone, or, alternatively, a combination of And, Or, and Not gates. These constructive approaches to logic design are theoretically equivalent, just as all theorems in geometry can be founded on different sets of axioms as alternative points of departure. The theory and practice of such constructions are covered in standard textbooks about digital design or logic design.\n  Throughout the chapter, we paid no attention to efficiency considerations such as the number of elementary gates used in constructing a composite gate or the number of wire crossovers implied by the design. Such considerations are critically important in practice, and a great deal of computer science and electrical engineering expertise focuses on optimizing them. Another issue we did not address at all is the physical implementation of gates and chips using the laws of physics, for example, the role of transistors embedded in silicon. There are of course several such implementation options, each having its own characteristics (speed, power requirements, production cost, etc.). Any nontrivial coverage of these issues requires some background in electronics and physics.\n"},"chapter01/05-Project.html":{"url":"chapter01/05-Project.html","title":"5.Project","keywords":"","body":"1.5 Project\n\n  Objective Implement all the logic gates presented in the chapter.

For each one of the chips mentioned in the chapter, we provide a skeletal .hdl program (text file) with a missing implementation part. In addition, for each chip we provide a .tst script file that tells the hardware simulator how to test it, along with the correct output file that this script should generate, called .cmp or “compare file.” Your job is to complete the missing implementation parts of the supplied .hdl programs.\n  Contract When loaded into the hardware simulator, your chip design (modified .hdl program), tested on the supplied .tst file, should produce the outputs listed in the supplied .cmp file. If that is not the case, the simulator will let you know.\n  Tips The Nand gate is considered primitive and thus there is no need to build it: Whenever you use Nand in one of your HDL programs, the simulator will automatically invoke its built-in tools/builtIn/Nand.hdl implementation. We recommend implementing the other gates in this project in the order in which they appear in the chapter. However, since the builtIn directory features working versions of all the chips described in the book, you can always use these chips without defining them first: The simulator will automatically use their built-in versions.\n\nFor example, consider the skeletal Mux.hdl program supplied in this project. Suppose that for one reason or another you did not complete this program’s implementation, but you still want to use Mux gates as internal parts in other chip designs. This is not a problem, thanks to the following convention. If our simulator fails to find a Mux.hdl file in the current directory, it automatically invokes a built-in Mux implementation, pre-supplied with the simulator’s software. This built-in implementation—a Java class stored in the built In directory—has the same interface and functionality as those of the Mux gate described in the book. Thus, if you want the simulator to ignore one or more of your chip implementations, simply move the corresponding .hdl files out of the current directory.\n\n  Steps We recommend proceeding in the following order:\n\nThe hardware simulator needed for this project is available in the tools directory of the book’s software suite.\nRead appendix A, sections A1-A6 only.\nGo through the hardware simulator tutorial, parts I, II, and III only.\nBuild and simulate all the chips specified in the projects/01 directory.\n\n"},"chapter02/00-Boolean_Arithmetic.html":{"url":"chapter02/00-Boolean_Arithmetic.html","title":"02. Boolean Arithmetic","keywords":"","body":"Chapter 2: Boolean Arithmetic\n\n\n\n  Counting is the religion of this generation, its hope and salvation.\n——Gertrude Stein (1874-1946)\n\n\n  In this chapter we build gate logic designs that represent numbers and perform arithmetic operations on them. Our starting point is the set of logic gates built in chapter 1, and our ending point is a fully functional Arithmetic Logical Unit. The ALU is the centerpiece chip that executes all the arithmetic and logical operations performed by the computer. Hence, building the ALU functionality is an important step toward understanding how the Central Processing Unit (CPU) and the overall computer work.\n  As usual, we approach this task gradually. The first section gives a brief Background on how binary codes and Boolean arithmetic can be used, respectively, to represent and add signed numbers. The Specification section describes a succession of adder chips, designed to add two bits, three bits, and pairs of n-bit binary numbers. This sets the stage for the ALU specification, which is based on a sophisticated yet simple logic design. The Implementation and Project sections provide tips and guidelines on how to build the adder chips and the ALU on a personal computer, using the hardware simulator supplied with the book.\n  Binary addition is a simple operation that runs deep. Remarkably, most of the operations performed by digital computers can be reduced to elementary additions of binary numbers. Therefore, constructive understanding of binary addition holds the key to the implementation of numerous computer operations that depend on it, one way or another.\n"},"chapter02/01-Background.html":{"url":"chapter02/01-Background.html","title":"1.Background","keywords":"","body":"2.1 Background\n\n  Binary Numbers Unlike the decimal system, which is founded on base 10, the binary system is founded on base 2. When we are given a certain binary pattern, say “10011,” and we are told that this pattern is supposed to represent an integer number, the decimal value of this number is computed by convention as follows:\n\n\n(1) In general, let x = xnxn-1 ...x0 be a string of digits. The value of x in base b, denoted (x)b, is defined as follows:\n\n\n(2) The reader can verify that in the case of (10011)two, rule (2) reduces to calculation (1). The result of calculation (1) happens to be 19. Thus, when we press the keyboard keys labeled ‘1’, ‘9’ and ENTER while running, say, a spreadsheet program, what ends up in some register in the computer’s memory is the binary code 10011. More precisely, if the computer happens to be a 32-bit machine, what gets stored in the register is the bit pattern 00000000000000000000000000010011.\n  Binary Addition A pair of binary numbers can be added digit by digit from right to left, according to the same elementary school method used in decimal addition. First, we add the two right-most digits, also called the least significant bits (LSB) of the two binary numbers. Next, we add the resulting carry bit (which is either 0 or 1) to the sum of the next pair of bits up the significance ladder. We continue the process until the two most significant bits (MSB) are added. If the last bit-wise addition generates a carry of 1, we can report overflow; otherwise, the addition completes successfully:\n\n\n  We see that computer hardware for binary addition of two n-bit numbers can be built from logic gates designed to calculate the sum of three bits (pair of bits plus carry bit). The transfer of the resulting carry bit forward to the addition of the next significant pair of bits can be easily accomplished by proper wiring of the 3-bit adder gates.\n  Signed Binary Numbers A binary system with n digits can generate a set of 2n different bit patterns. If we have to represent signed numbers in binary code, a natural solution is to split this space into two equal subsets. One subset of codes is assigned to represent positive numbers, and the other negative numbers. Ideally, the coding scheme should be chosen in such a way that the introduction of signed numbers would complicate the hardware implementation as little as possible. This challenge has led to the development of several coding schemes for representing signed numbers in binary code. The method used today by almost all computers is called the 2’s complement method, also known as radix complement. In a binary system with n digits, the 2’s complement of the number x is defined as follows:\n\n\n  For example, in a 5-bit binary system, the 2’s complement representation of–2 or “minus(00010)two” is 25–(00010)two = (32)ten–(2)ten = (30)ten = (11110)two. To check the calculation, the reader can verify that (00010)two + (11110)two = (00000)two. Note that in the latter computation, the sum is actually (100000)two, but since we are dealing with a 5-bit binary system, the left-most sixth bit is simply ignored. As a rule, when the 2’s complement method is applied to n-bit numbers, x + (–x) always sums up to 2n (i.e., 1 followed by n 0’s)—a property that gives the method its name. Figure 2.1 illustrates a 4-bit binary systemwith the 2’s complement method.\n  An inspection of figure 2.1 suggests that an n-bit binary system with 2’s complement representation has the following properties:\n\n\n  Figure 2.1 2’s complement representation of signed numbers in a 4-bit binary system.\n  ■ The systemcan code a total of 2n signed numbers, of which the maximal and minimal numbers are 2n-1–1 and–2n-1, respectively.\n  ■ The codes of all positive numbers begin with a 0.\n  ■ The codes of all negative numbers begin with a 1.\n  ■ To obtain the code of–x fromthe code of x, leave all the trailing (least significant) 0’s and the first least significant 1 intact, then flip all the remaining bits (convert 0’s to 1’s and vice versa). An equivalent shortcut, which is easier to implement in hardware, is to flip all the bits of x and add 1 to the result.\n  A particularly attractive feature of this representation is that addition of any two signed numbers in 2’s complement is exactly the same as addition of positive numbers. Consider, for example, the addition operation (–2) + (–3). Using 2’s complement (in a 4-bit representation), we have to add, in binary, (1110)two + (1101)two. Without paying any attention to which numbers (positive or negative) these codes represent, bit-wise addition will yield 1011 (after throwing away the overflow bit). As figure 2.1 shows, this indeed is the 2’s complement representation of -5.\n  In short, we see that the 2’s complement method facilitates the addition of any two signed numbers without requiring special hardware beyond that needed for simple bit-wise addition. What about subtraction? Recall that in the 2’s complement method, the arithmetic negation of a signed number x, that is, computing–x, is achieved by negating all the bits of x and adding 1 to the result. Thus subtraction can be easily handled by x–y = x + (–y). Once again, hardware complexity is kept to a minimum.\n  The material implications of these theoretical results are significant. Basically, they imply that a single chip, called Arithmetic Logical Unit, can be used to encapsulate all the basic arithmetic and logical operators performed in hardware. We now turn to specify one suchALU, beginning with the specification of an adder chip.\n"},"chapter02/02-Specification.html":{"url":"chapter02/02-Specification.html","title":"2.Specification","keywords":"","body":"2.2 Specification\n\n2.2.1 Adders\n  We present a hierarchy of three adders, leading to a multi-bit adder chip:\n\nHalf-adder: designed to add two bits\nFull-adder: designed to add three bits\nAdder: designed to add two n-bit numbers\n\n\n\n  Figure 2.2 Half-adder, designed to add 2 bits.\n  We also present a special-purpose adder, called incrementer, designed to add 1 to a given number.\n  Half-Adder The first step on our way to adding binary numbers is to be able to add two bits. Let us call the least significant bit of the addition sum, and the most significant bit carry. Figure 2.2 presents a chip, called half-adder, designed to carry out this operation.\n  Full-Adder Now that we know how to add two bits, figure 2.3 presents a full-adder chip, designed to add three bits. Like the half-adder case, the full-adder chip produces two outputs: the least significant bit of the addition, and the carry bit.\n  Adder Memory and register chips represent integer numbers by n-bit patterns, n being 16, 32, 64, and so forth—depending on the computer platform. The chip whose job is to add such numbers is called a multibit adder, or simply adder. Figure 2.4 presents a 16-bit adder, noting that the same logic and specifications scale up as is to any n-bit adder.\n  Incrementer It is convenient to have a special-purpose chip dedicated to adding the constant 1 to a given\nnumber. Here is the specification of a 16-bit incrementer:\n\n\n  Figure 2.3 Full-adder, designed to add 3 bits.\n\n\n  Figure 2.4 16-bit adder. Addition of two n-bit binary numbers for any n is “more of the same.”\n\n\n\n\n2.2.2 The Arithmetic Logic Unit (ALU)\n  The specifications of the adder chips presented so far were generic, meaning that they hold for any computer. In contrast, this section describes an ALU that will later become the centerpiece of a specific computer platform called Hack. At the same time, the principles underlying the design of our ALU are rather general. Further, our ALU architecture achieves a great deal of functionality using a minimal set of internal parts. In that respect, it provides a good example of an efficient and elegant logic design.\n  The Hack ALU computes a fixed set of functions out = fi(x, y) where x and y are the chip’s two 16-bit inputs, out is the chip’s 16-bit output, and fi is an arithmetic or logical function selected from a fixed repertoire of eighteen possible functions. We instruct the ALU which function to compute by setting six input bits, called control bits, to selected binary values. The exact input-output specification is given in figure 2.5, using pseudo-code.\n  Note that each one of the six control bits instructs the ALU to carry out a certain elementary operation. Taken together, the combined effects of these operations cause the ALU to compute a variety of useful functions. Since the overall operation is driven by six control bits, the ALU can potentially compute 26 = 64 different functions. Eighteen of these functions are documented in figure 2.6.\n  We see that programming our ALU to compute a certain function f(x, y) is done by setting the six control bits to the code of the desired function. From this point on, the internal ALU logic specified in figure 2.5 should cause the ALU to output the value f(x, y) specified in figure 2.6. Of course, this does not happen miraculously, it’s the result of careful design.\n  For example, let us consider the twelfth row of figure 2.6, where the ALU is instructed to compute the function x-1. The zx and nx bits are 0, so the x input is neither zeroed nor negated. The zy and ny bits are 1, so the y input is first zeroed, and then negated bit-wise. Bit-wise negation of zero, (000 ...00)two , gives (111 ...11)two , the 2’s complement code of -1. Thus the ALU inputs end up being x and -1. Since the f-bit is 1, the selected operation is arithmetic addition, causing the ALU to calculate x+ (-1). Finally, since the no bit is 0, the output is not negated but rather left as is. To conclude, the ALU ends up computing x-1, which was our goal.\n\n\n\n\n  Figure 2.5 The Arithmetic Logic Unit.\n\n\n  Figure 2.6 The ALU truth table. Taken together, the binary operations coded by the first six columns effect the function listed in the right column (we use the symbols !, &, and | to represent the operators Not, And, and Or, respectively, performed bit-wise). The complete ALU truth table consists of sixty-four rows, of which only the eighteen presented here are of interest.\n  Does the ALU logic described in figure 2.6 compute every one of the other seventeen functions listed in the figure’s right column? To verify that this is indeed the case, the reader can pick up some other rows in the table and prove their respective ALU operation. We note that some of these computations, beginning with the function f(x, y) = 1, are not trivial. We also note that there are some other useful functions computed by the ALU but not listed in the figure.\n  It may be instructive to describe the thought process that led to the design of this particular ALU. First, we made a list of all the primitive operations that we wanted our computer to be able to perform (right column in figure 2.6). Next, we used backward reasoning to figure out how x, y, and out can be manipulated in binary fashion in order to carry out the desired operations. These processing requirements, along with our objective to keep the ALU logic as simple as possible, have led to the design decision to use six control bits, each associated with a straightforward binary operation. The resultingALU is simple and elegant. And in the hardware business, simplicity and elegance imply inexpensive and powerful computer systems.\n"},"chapter02/03-Implementation.html":{"url":"chapter02/03-Implementation.html","title":"3.Implementation","keywords":"","body":"2.3 Implementation\n\n  Our implementation guidelines are intentionally partial, since we want you to discover the actual chip architectures yourself. As usual, each chip can be implemented in more than one way; the simpler the implementation, the better.\n  Half-Adder An inspection of figure 2.2 reveals that the functions sum(a, b) and carry(a, b) happen to be identical to the standard Xor(a, b) and And(a, b) Boolean functions. Thus, the implementation of this adder is straightforward, using previously built gates.\n  Full-Adder A full adder chip can be implemented from two half adder chips and one additional simple gate. A direct implementation is also possible, without using half-adder chips.\n  Adder The addition of two signed numbers represented by the 2’s complement method as two n-bit buses can be done bit-wise, from right to left, in n steps. In step 0, the least significant pair of bits is added, and the carry bit is fed into the addition of the next significant pair of bits. The process continues until in step n–1 the most significant pair of bits is added. Note that each step involves the addition of three bits. Hence, an n-bit adder can be implemented by creating an array of n full-adder chips and propagating the carry bits up the significance ladder.\n  Incrementer An n-bit incrementer can be implemented trivially from an n-bit adder. ALU Note that our ALU was carefully planned to effect all the desired ALU operations logically, using simple Boolean operations. Therefore, the physical implementation of the ALU is reduced to implementing these simple Boolean operations, following their pseudo-code specifications. Your first step will likely be to create a logic circuit that manipulates a 16-bit input according to the nx and zx control bits (i.e., the circuit should conditionally zero and negate the 16-bit input). This logic can be used to manipulate the x and y inputs, as well as the out output. Chips for bit-wise And-ing and addition have already been built in this and in the previous chapter. Thus, what remains is to build logic that chooses between them according to the f control bit. Finally, you will need to build logic that integrates all the other chips into the overall ALU. (When we say “build logic,” we mean “write HDL code”).\n"},"chapter02/04-Perspective.html":{"url":"chapter02/04-Perspective.html","title":"4.Perspective","keywords":"","body":"2.4 Perspective\n\n  The construction of the multi-bit adder presented in this chapter was standard, although no attention was paid to efficiency. In fact, our suggested adder implementation is rather inefficient, due to the long delays incurred while the carry bit propagates from the least significant bit pair to the most significant bit pair. This problem can be alleviated using logic circuits that effect so-called carry look-ahead techniques. Since addition is one of the most prevalent operations in any given hardware platform, any such low-level improvement can result in dramatic and global performance gains throughout the computer.\n  In any given computer, the overall functionality of the hardware/software platform is delivered jointly by the ALU and the operating system that runs on top of it. Thus, when designing a new computer system, the question of how much functionality the ALU should deliver is essentially a cost/performance issue. The general rule is that hardware implementations of arithmetic and logical operations are usually more costly, but achieve better performance. The design trade-off that we have chosen in this book is to specify an ALU hardware with a limited functionality and then implement as many operations as possible in software. For example, our ALU features neither multiplication nor division nor floating point arithmetic. We will implement some of these operations (as well as more mathematical functions) at the operating systemlevel, described in chapter 12.\n  Detailed treatments of Boolean arithmetic and ALU design can be found in most computer architecture textbooks.\n"},"chapter02/05-Project.html":{"url":"chapter02/05-Project.html","title":"5.Project","keywords":"","body":"2.5 Project\n\n  Objective Implement all the chips presented in this chapter.

Sequential Logic","keywords":"","body":"Chapter 3: Sequential Logic\n\n\n\n  It’s a poor sort of memory that only works backward.\n——Lewis Carroll (1832-1898)\n\n\n  All the Boolean and arithmetic chips that we built in chapters 1 and 2 were combinational. Combinational chips compute functions that depend solely on combinations of their input values. These relatively simple chips provide many important processing functions (like the ALU), but they cannot maintain state. Since computers must be able to not only compute values but also store and recall values, they must be equipped with memory elements that can preserve data over time. These memory elements are built from sequential chips.\n  The implementation of memory elements is an intricate art involving synchronization, clocking, and feedback loops. Conveniently, most of this complexity can be embedded in the operating logic of very low-level sequential gates called flip-flops. Using these flip-flops as elementary building blocks, we will specify and build all the memory devices employed by typical modern computers, from binary cells to registers to memory banks and counters. This effort will complete the construction of the chip set needed to build an entire computer—a challenge that we take up in the chapter 5.\n  Following a brief overview of clocks and flip-flops, the Background section introduces all the memory chips that we will build on top of them. The next two sections describe the chips Specification and Implementation, respectively. As usual, all the chips mentioned in the chapter can be built and tested using the hardware simulator supplied with the book, following the instructions given in the final Project section.\n"},"chapter03/01-Background.html":{"url":"chapter03/01-Background.html","title":"1.Background","keywords":"","body":"3.1 Background\n\n  The act of “remembering something” is inherently time-dependent: You remember now what has been committed to memory before. Thus, in order to build chips that “remember” information, we must first develop some standard means for representing the progression of time.\n  The Clock In most computers, the passage of time is represented by a master clock that delivers a continuous train of alternating signals. The exact hardware implementation is usually based on an oscillator that alternates continuously between two phases labeled 0-1, low-high, tick-tock, etc. The elapsed time between the beginning of a “tick” and the end of the subsequent “tock” is called cycle, and each clock cycle is taken to model one discrete time unit. The current clock phase (tick or tock) is represented by a binary signal. Using the hardware’s circuitry, this signal is simultaneously broadcast to every sequential chip throughout the computer platform.\n  Flip-Flops The most elementary sequential element in the computer is a device called a flip-flop, of which there are several variants. In this book we use a variant called a data flip-flop, or DFF, whose interface consists of a single-bit data input and a single-bit data output. In addition, the DFF has a clock input that continuously changes according to the master clock’s signal. Taken together, the data and the clock inputs enable the DFF to implement the time-based behavior out(t) = in(t - 1), where in and out are the gate’s input and output values and t is the current clock cycle. In other words, the DFF simply outputs the input value from the previous time unit.\n  As we now show, this elementary behavior can form the basis of all the hardware devices that computers use to maintain state, from binary cells to registers to arbitrarily large random access memory (RAM) units.\n  Registers A register is a storage device that can “store,” or “remember,” a value over time, implementing the classical storage behavior out(t) = out(t - 1). A DFF, on the other hand, can only output its previous input, namely, out(t) = in(t - 1). This suggests that a register can be implemented from a DFF by simply feeding the output of the latter back into its input, creating the device shown in the middle of figure 3.1. Presumably, the output of this device at any time t will echo its output at time t - 1, yielding the classical function expected from a storage unit.\n\n\n  Figure 3.1 From a DFF to a single-bit register. The small triangle represents the clock input. This icon is used to state that the marked chip, as well as the overall chip that encapsulates it, is time-dependent.\n  Well, not so. The device shown in the middle of figure 3.1 is invalid. First, it is not clear how we’ll ever be able to load this device with a new data value, since there are no means to tell the DFF when to draw its input from the in wire and when from the out wire. More generally, the rules of chip design dictate that internal pins must have a fan-in of 1, meaning that they can be fed from a single source only.\n  The good thing about this thought experiment is that it leads us to the correct and elegant solution shown in the right side of figure 3.1. In particular, a natural way to resolve our input ambiguity is to introduce a multiplexor into the design. Further, the “select bit” of this multiplexor can become the “load bit” of the overall register chip: If we want the register to start storing a new value, we can put this value in the in input and set the load bit to 1; if we want the register to keep storing its internal value until further notice, we can set the load bit to 0.\n  Once we have developed the basic mechanism for remembering a single bit over time, we can easily construct arbitrarily wide registers. This can be achieved by forming an array of as many single-bit registers as needed, creating a register that holds multi-bit values (figure 3.2). The basic design parameter of such a register is its width—the number of bits that it holds—e.g., 16, 32, or 64. The multi-bit contents of such registers are typically referred to as words.\n  Memories Once we have the basic ability to represent words, we can proceed to build memory banks of arbitrary length. As figure 3.3 shows, this can be done by stacking together many registers to form a Random Access Memory RAM unit. The term random access memory derives from the requirement that read/write operations on a RAM should be able to access randomly chosen words, with no restrictions on the order in which they are accessed. That is to say, we require that any word in the memory— irrespective of its physical location—be accessed directly, in equal speed.\n\n\n  Figure 3.2 From single-bit to multi-bit registers. A multi-bit register of width w can be constructed from an array of w 1-bit chips. The operating functions of both chips is exactly the same, except that the “=” assignments are single-bit and multi-bit, respectively.\n\n\n  Figure 3.3 RAM chip (conceptual). The width and length of the RAM can vary.\n  This requirement can be satisfied as follows. First, we assign each word in the n-register RAM a unique address (an integer between 0 to n - 1), according to which it will be accessed. Second, in addition to building an array of n registers, we build a gate logic design that, given an address j, is capable of selecting the individual register whose address is j. Note however that the notion of an “address” is not an explicit part of the RAM design, since the registers are not “marked” with addresses in any physical sense. Rather, as we will see later, the chip is equipped with direct access logic that implements the notion of addressing using logical means.\n  In sum, a classical RAM device accepts three inputs: a data input, an address input, and a load bit. The address specifies which RAM register should be accessed in the current time unit. In the case of a read operation (load=0), the RAM’s output immediately emits the value of the selected register. In the case of a write operation (load=1), the selected memory register commits to the input value in the next time unit, at which point the RAM’s output will start emitting it.\n  The basic design parameters of a RAM device are its data width—the width of each one of its words, and its size—the number of words in the RAM. Modern computers typically employ 32- or 64-bit-wide RAMs whose sizes are up to hundreds of millions.\n  Counters A counter is a sequential chip whose state is an integer number that increments every time unit, effecting the function out(t) = out(t - 1) + c, where c is typically 1. Counters play an important role in digital architectures. For example, a typical CPU includes a program counter whose output is interpreted as the address of the instruction that should be executed next in the current program.\nA counter chip can be implemented by combining the input/output logic of a standard register with the combinatorial logic for adding a constant. Typically, the counter will have to be equipped with some additional functionality, such as possibilities for resetting the count to zero, loading a new counting base, or decrementing instead of incrementing.\n  Time Matters All the chips described so far in this chapter are sequential. Simply stated, a sequential chip is a chip that embeds one or more DFF gates, either directly or indirectly. Functionally speaking, the DFF gates endow sequential chips with the ability to either maintain state (as in memory units) or operate on state (as in counters). Technically speaking, this is done by forming feedback loops inside the sequential chip (see figure 3.4). In combinational chips, where time is neither modeled nor recognized, the introduction of feedback loops is problematic: The output would depend on the input, which itself would depend on the output, and thus the output would depend on itself. On the other hand, there is no difficulty in feeding the output of a sequential chip back into itself, since the DFFs introduce an inherent time delay: The output at time t does not depend on itself, but rather on the output at time t - 1. This property guards against the uncontrolled “data races” that would occur in combinational chips with feedback loops.\n\n\n  Figure 3.4 Combinational versus sequential logic (in and out stand for one or more input and output variables). Sequential chips always consist of a layer of DFFs sandwiched between optional combinational logic layers.\n  Recall that the outputs of combinational chips change when their inputs change, irrespective of time. In contrast, the inclusion of the DFFs in the sequential architecture ensures that their outputs change only at the point of transition from one clock cycle to the next, and not within the cycle itself. In fact, we allow sequential chips to be in unstable states during clock cycles, requiring only that at the beginning of the next cycle they output correct values.\n  This “discretization” of the sequential chips’ outputs has an important side effect: It can be used to synchronize the overall computer architecture. To illustrate, suppose we instruct the arithmetic logic unit (ALU) to compute x + y where x is the value of a nearby register and y is the value of a remote RAM register. Because of various physical constraints (distance, resistance, interference, random noise, etc.) the electric signals representing x and y will likely arrive at the ALU at different times. However, being a combinational chip, the ALU is insensitive to the concept of time—it continuously adds up whichever data values happen to lodge in its inputs. Thus, it will take some time before the ALU’s output stabilizes to the correct x + y result. Until then, the ALU will generate garbage.\n  How can we overcome this difficulty? Well, since the output of the ALU is always routed to some sort of a sequential chip (a register, a RAM location, etc.), we don’t really care. All we have to do is ensure, when we build the computer’s clock, that the length of the clock cycle will be slightly longer that the time it takes a bit to travel the longest distance from one chip in the architecture to another. This way, we are guaranteed that by the time the sequential chip updates its state (at the beginning of the next clock cycle), the inputs that it receives from the ALU will be valid. This, in a nutshell, is the trick that synchronizes a set of stand-alone hardware components into a well-coordinated system, as we shall see in chapter 5.\n"},"chapter03/02-Specification.html":{"url":"chapter03/02-Specification.html","title":"2.Specification","keywords":"","body":"3.2 Specification\n\n  This section specifies a hierarchy of sequential chips:\n    • Data-flip-flops (DFFs)\n    • Registers (based on DFFs)\n    • Memory banks (based on registers)\n    • Counter chips (also based on registers)\n3.2.1 Data-Flip-Flop\n  The most elementary sequential device that we present—the basic component from which all memory elements will be designed—is the data flip-flop gate.

All these DFFs are connected to the same master clock, forming a huge distributed “chorus line.” At the beginning of each clock cycle, the outputs of all the DFFs in the computer commit to their inputs during the previous time unit. At all other times, the DFFs are “latched,” meaning that changes in their inputs have no immediate effect on their outputs. This conduction operation effects any one of the millions of DFF gates that make up the system, about a billion times per second (depending on the computer’s clock frequency).\n  Hardware implementations achieve this time dependency by simultaneously feeding the master clock signal to all the DFF gates in the platform. Hardware simulators emulate the same effect in software. As far as the computer architect is concerned, the end result is the same: The inclusion of a DFF gate in the design of any chip ensures that the overall chip, as well as all the chips up the hardware hierarchy that depend on it, will be inherently time-dependent. These chips are called sequential, by definition.\n  The physical implementation of a DFF is an intricate task, and is based on connecting several elementary logic gates using feedback loops (one classic design is based on Nand gates alone). In this book we have chosen to abstract away this complexity, treating DFFs as primitive building blocks. Thus, our hardware simulator provides a built-in DFF implementation that can be readily used by other chips.\n3.2.2 Registers\n  A single-bit register, which we call Bit, or binary cell, is designed to store a single bit of information (0 or 1). The chip interface consists of an input pin that carries a data bit, a load pin that enables the cell for writes, and an output pin that emits the current state of the cell. The interface diagram and API of a binary cell are as follows:\n\n\n  The API of the Register chip is essentially the same, except that the input and output pins are designed to handle multi-bit values:\n\n\n  Read: To read the contents of a register, we simply probe its output.\n  Write: To write a new data value d into a register, we put d in the in input and assert (set to 1) the load input. In the next clock cycle, the register commits to the new data value, and its output starts emitting d.\n3.2.3 Memory\n  A direct-access memory unit, also called RAM, is an array of n w-bit registers, equipped with direct access circuitry. The number of registers (n) and the width of each register (w) are called the memory’s size and width, respectively. We will now set out to build a hierarchy of such memory devices, all 16 bits wide, but with varying sizes: RAM8, RAM64, RAM512, RAM4K, and RAM16K units. All these memory chips have precisely the same API, and thus we describe them in one parametric diagram:\n\n\n  Read: To read the contents of register number m, we put m in the address input. The RAM’s direct-access logic will select register number m, which will then emit its output value to the RAM’s output pin. This is a combinational operation, independent of the clock.\n  Write: To write a new data value d into register number m, we put m in the address input, d in the in input, and assert the load input bit. This causes the RAM’s direct-access logic to select register number m, and the load bit to enable it. In the next clock cycle, the selected register will commit to the new value (d), and the RAM’s output will start emitting it.\n3.2.4 Counter\n  Although a counter is a stand-alone abstraction in its own right, it is convenient to motivate its specification by saying a few words about the context in which it is normally used. For example, consider a counter chip designed to contain the address of the instruction that the computer should fetch and execute next. In most cases, the counter has to simply increment itself by 1 in each clock cycle, thus causing the computer to fetch the next instruction in the program. In other cases, for example, in “jump to execute instruction number n,” we want to be able to set the counter to n, then have it continue its default counting behavior with n + 1, n + 2, and so forth. Finally, the program’s execution can be restarted anytime by resetting the counter to 0, assuming that that’s the address of the program’s first instruction. In short, we need a loadable and resettable counter.\n  With that in mind, the interface of our Counter chip is similar to that of a register, except that it has two additional control bits labeled reset and inc. When inc=1, the counter increments its state in every clock cycle, emitting the value out(t)= out (t-1)+1. If we want to reset the counter to 0, we assert the reset bit; if we want to initialize it to some other counting base d, we put d in the in input and assert the load bit. The details are given in the counter API, and an example of its operation is depicted in figure 3.5.\n"},"chapter03/03-Implementation.html":{"url":"chapter03/03-Implementation.html","title":"3.Implementation","keywords":"","body":"3.3 Implementation\n\n  Flip-Flop DFF gates can be implemented from lower-level logic gates like those built in chapter 1. However, in this book we treat DFFs as primitive gates, and thus they can be used in hardware construction projects without worrying about their internal implementation.\n\n\n  Figure 3.5 Counter simulation. At time 23 a reset signal is issued, causing the counter to emit 0 in the following time unit. The 0 persists until an inc signal is issued at time 25, causing the counter to start incrementing, one time unit later. The counting continues until, at time 29, the load bit is asserted. Since the counter’s input holds the number 527, the counter is reset to that value in the next time unit. Since inc is still asserted, the counter continues incrementing until time 33, when inc is de-asserted.\n  1-Bit Register (Bit) The implementation of this chip was given in figure 3.1.\n  Register The construction of a w-bit Register chip from 1-bit registers is straightforward. All we have to do is construct an array of w Bit gates and feed the register’s load input to every one of them.\n  8-Register Memory (RAM8) An inspection of figure 3.3 may be useful here. To implement a RAM8 chip, we line up an array of eight registers. Next, we have to build combinational logic that, given a certain address value, takes the RAM8’s in input and loads it into the selected register. In a similar fashion, we have to build combinational logic that, given a certain address value, selects the right register and pipes its out value to the RAM8’s out output. Tip: This combinational logic was already implemented in chapter 1.\n  n-Register Memory A memory bank of arbitrary length (a power of 2) can be built recursively from smaller memory units, all the way down to the single register level. This view is depicted in figure 3.6. Focusing on the right-hand side of the figure, we note that a 64-register RAM can be built from an array of eight 8-register RAM chips. To select a particular register from the RAM64 memory, we use a 6-bit address, say xxxyyy. The MSB xxx bits select one of the RAM8 chips, and the LSB yyy bits select one of the registers within the selected RAM8. The RAM64 chip should be equipped with logic circuits that effect this hierarchical addressing scheme.\n  Counter A w-bit counter consists of two main elements: a regular w-bit register, and combinational logic. The combinational logic is designed to (a) compute the counting function, and (b) put the counter in the right operating mode, as mandated by the values of its three control bits. Tip: Most of this logic was already built in chapter 2.\n"},"chapter03/04-Perspective.html":{"url":"chapter03/04-Perspective.html","title":"4.Perspective","keywords":"","body":"3.4 Perspective\n\n  The cornerstone of all the memory systems described in this chapter is the flip-flop—a gate that we treated here as an atomic, or primitive, building block. The usual approach in hardware textbooks is to construct flip-flops from elementary combinatorial gates (e.g., Nand gates) using appropriate feedback loops. The standard construction begins by building a simple (non-clocked) flip-flop that is bi-stable, namely, that can be set to be in one of two states. Then a clocked flip-flop is obtained by cascading two such simple flip-flops, the first being set when the clock ticks and the second when the clock tocks. This “master-slave” design endows the overall flip-flop with the desired clocked synchronization functionality.\n\n\n  Figure 3.6 Gradual construction of memory banks by recursive ascent. A w-bit register is an array of w binary cells, an 8-register RAM is an array of eight w-bit registers, a 64-register RAM is an array of eight RAM8 chips, and so on. Only three more similar construction steps are necessary to build a 16K RAM chip.\n  These constructions are rather elaborate, requiring an understating of delicate issues like the effect of feedback loops on combinatorial circuits, as well as the implementation of clock cycles using a two- phase binary clock signal. In this book we have chosen to abstract away these low-level considerations by treating the flip-flop as an atomic gate. Readers who wish to explore the internal structure of flip-flop gates can find detailed descriptions in most logic design and computer architecture textbooks.\n  In closing, we should mention that memory devices of modern computers are not always constructed from standard flip-flops. Instead, modern memory chips are usually very carefully optimized, exploiting the unique physical properties of the underlying storage technology. Many such alternative technologies are available today to computer designers; as usual, which technology to use is a cost-performance issue.\n  Aside from these low-level considerations, all the other chip constructions in this chapter—the registers and memory chips that were built on top of the flip-flop gates—were standard.\n"},"chapter03/05-Project.html":{"url":"chapter03/05-Project.html","title":"5.Project","keywords":"","body":"3.5 Project\n\n  Objective Build all the chips described in the chapter. The only building blocks that you can use are primitive DFF gates, chips that you will build on top of them, and chips described in previous chapters.\n  Resources The only tool that you need for this project is the hardware simulator supplied with the book. All the chips should be implemented in the HDL language specified in appendix A. As usual, for each chip we supply a skeletal .hdl program with a missing implementation part, a .tst script file that tells the hardware simulator how to test it, and a .cmp compare file. Your job is to complete the missing implementation parts of the supplied .hdl programs.\n  Contract When loaded into the hardware simulator, your chip design (modified .hdl program), tested on the supplied .tst file, should produce the outputs listed in the supplied .cmp file. If that is not the case, the simulator will let you know.\n  Tip The Data Flip-Flop (DFF) gate is considered primitive and thus there is no need to build it: When the simulator encounters a DFF gate in an HDL program, it automatically invokes the built-in tools/builtIn/DFF.hdl implementation.\n  The Directory Structure of This Project When constructing RAM chips from smaller ones, we recommend using built-in versions of the latter. Otherwise, the simulator may run very slowly or even out of (real) memory space, since large RAM chips contain tens of thousands of lower-level chips, and all these chips are kept in memory (as software objects) by the simulator. For this reason, we have placed the RAM512.hdl, RAM4K.hdl, and RAM16K.hdl programs in a separate directory. This way, the recursive descent construction of the RAM4K and RAM16K chips stops with the RAM512 chip, whereas the lower-level chips from which the latter chip is made are bound to be built-in (since the simulator does not find them in this directory).\n  Steps We recommend proceeding in the following order:\n  0. The hardware simulator needed for this project is available in the tools directory of the book’s software suite.\n  1. Read appendix A, focusing on sections A.6 and A.7.\n  2.

Machine Language","keywords":"","body":"Chapter 4: Machine Language\n\n\n\n  Make everything as simple as possible, but not simpler.\n——Albert Einstein (1879-1955)\n\n\n  A computer can be described constructively, by laying out its hardware platform and explaining how it is built from low-level chips. A computer can also be described abstractly, by specifying and demonstrating its machine language capabilities. And indeed, it is convenient to get acquainted with a new computer system by first seeing some low-level programs written in its machine language. This helps us understand not only how to program the computer to do useful things, but also why its hardware was designed in a certain way. With that in mind, this chapter focuses on low-level programming in machine language. This sets the stage for chapter 5, where we complete the construction of a general-purpose computer designed to run machine language programs. This computer will be constructed from the chip set built in chapters 1-3.\n  A machine language is an agreed-upon formalism, designed to code low-level programs as series of machine instructions. Using these instructions, the programmer can command the processor to perform arithmetic and logic operations, fetch and store values from and to the memory, move values from one register to another, test Boolean conditions, and so on. As opposed to high-level languages, whose basic design goals are generality and power of expression, the goal of machine language’s design is direct execution in, and total control of, a given hardware platform. Of course, generality, power, and elegance are still desired, but only to the extent that they support the basic requirement of direct execution in hardware.\n  Machine language is the most profound interface in the overall computer enterprise—the fine line where hardware and software meet. This is the point where the abstract thoughts of the programmer, as manifested in symbolic instructions, are turned into physical operations performed in silicon. Thus, machine language can be construed as both a programming tool and an integral part of the hardware platform. In fact, just as we say that the machine language is designed to exploit a given hardware platform, we can say that the hardware platform is designed to fetch, interpret, and execute instructions written in the given machine language.\n  The chapter begins with a general introduction to machine language programming. Next, we give a detailed specification of the Hack machine language, covering both its binary and its symbolic assembly versions. The project that ends the chapter engages you in writing a couple of machine language programs. This project offers a hands-on appreciation of low-level programming and prepares you for building the computer itself in the next chapter.\n  Although most people will never write programs directly in machine language, the study of low-level programming is a prerequisite to a complete understanding of computer architectures. Also, it is rather fascinating to realize how the most sophisticated software systems are, at bottom, long series of elementary instructions, each specifying a very simple and primitive operation on the underlying hardware. As usual, this understanding is best achieved constructively, by writing some low-level code and running it directly on the hardware platform.\n"},"chapter04/01-Background.html":{"url":"chapter04/01-Background.html","title":"1.Background","keywords":"","body":"4.1 Background\n\n  This chapter is language-oriented. Therefore, we can abstract away most of the details of the underlying hardware platform, deferring its description to the next chapter. Indeed, to give a general description of machine languages, it is sufficient to focus on three main abstractions only: a processor, a memory, and a set of registers.\n4.1.1 Machines\n  A machine language can be viewed as an agreed-upon formalism, designed to manipulate a memory using a processor and a set of registers.\n  Memory The term memory refers loosely to the collection of hardware devices that store data and instructions in a computer. From the programmer’s standpoint, all memories have the same structure: A continuous array of cells of some fixed width, also called words or locations, each having a unique address. Hence, an individual word (representing either a data item or an instruction) is specified by supplying its address. In what follows we will refer to such individual words using the equivalent notation Memory[address], RAM[address], or M[address] for brevity.\n  Processor The processor, normally called Central Processing Unit or CPU, is a device capable of performing a fixed set of elementary operations. These typically include arithmetic and logic operations, memory access operations, and control (also called branching) operations. The operands of these operations are binary values that come from registers and selected memory locations. Likewise, the results of the operations (the processor’s output) can be stored either in registers or in selected memory locations.\n  Registers Memory access is a relatively slow operation, requiring long instruction formats (an address may require 32 bits). For this reason, most processors are equipped with several registers, each capable of holding a single value. Located in the processor’s immediate proximity, the registers serve as a high- speed local memory, allowing the processor to manipulate data and instructions quickly. This setting enables the programmer to minimize the use of memory access commands, thus speeding up the program’s execution.\n4.1.2 Languages\n  A machine language program is a series of coded instructions. For example, a typical instruction in a 16- bit computer may be 1010001100011001. In order to figure out what this instruction means, we have to know the rules of the game, namely, the instruction set of the underlying hardware platform. For example, the language may be such that each instruction consists of four 4-bit fields: The left-most field codes a CPU operation, and the remaining three fields represent the operation’s operands. Thus the previous command may code the operation set R3 to R1 + R9, depending of course on the hardware specification and the machine language syntax.\n  Since binary codes are rather cryptic, machine languages are normally specified using both binary codes and symbolic mnemonics (a mnemonic is a symbolic label whose name hints at what it stands for— in our case hardware elements and binary operations). For example, the language designer can decide that the operation code 1010 will be represented by the mnemonic add and that the registers of the machine will be symbolically referred to using the symbols R0, R1, R2, and so forth. Using these conventions, one can specify machine language instructions either directly, as 1010001100011001, or symbolically, as, say, ADD R3,R1,R9.\n  Taking this symbolic abstraction one step further, we can allow ourselves not only to read symbolic notation, but to actually write programs using symbolic commands rather than binary instructions. Next, we can use a text processing program to parse the symbolic commands into their underlying fields (mnemonics and operands), translate each field into its equivalent binary representation, and assemble the resulting codes into binary machine instructions. The symbolic notation is called assembly language, or simply assembly, and the program that translates from assembly to binary is called assembler.\n  Since different computers vary in terms of CPU operations, number and type of registers, and assembly syntax rules, there is a Tower of Babel of machine languages, each with its own obscure syntax. Yet irrespective of this variety, all machine languages support similar sets of generic commands, which we now describe.\n4.1.3 Commands\n  Arithmetic and Logic Operations Every computer is required to perform basic arithmetic operations like addition and subtraction as well as basic Boolean operations like bit-wise negation, bit shifting, and so forth. Here are some examples, written in typical machine language syntax:\n  ADD RR2,R1,R3    // R2  Memory Access Memory access commands fall into two categories. First, as we have just seen, arithmetic and logical commands are allowed to operate not only on registers, but also on selected memory locations. Second, all computers feature explicit load and store commands, designed to move data between registers and memory. These memory access commands may use several types of addressing modes—ways of specifying the address of the required memory word. As usual, different computers offer different possibilities and different notations, but the following three memory access modes are almost always supported:\n■ Direct addressing The most common way to address the memory is to express a specific address or use a symbol that refers to a specific address, as follows:\n  LOAD R1,67   // R1  ■ Immediate addressing This form of addressing is used to load constants—namely, load values that appear in the instruction code: Instead of treating the numeric field that appears in the instruction as an address, we simply load the value of the field itself into the register, as follows:\n  LOAD R1,67   // R1  ■ Indirect addressing In this addressing mode the address of the required memory location is not hard- coded into the instruction; instead, the instruction specifies a memory location that holds the required address. This addressing mode is used to handle pointers. For example, consider the high-level command x=foo[j], where foo is an array variable and x and j are integer variables. What is the machine language equivalent of this command? Well, when the array foo is declared and initialized in the high-level program, the compiler allocates a memory segment to hold the array data and makes the symbol foo refer to the base address of that segment.\nNow, when the compiler later encounters references to array cells like foo[j], it translates them as follows. First, note that the jth array entry should be physically located in a memory location that is at a displacement j from the array’s base address (assuming, for simplicity, that each array element uses a single word). Hence the address corresponding to the expression foo[j] can be easily calculated by adding the value of j to the value of foo. Thus in the C programming language, for example, a command like x=foo[j] can be also expressed as x=*(foo+j), where the notation “*n” stands for “the value of Memory[n]”. When translated into machine language, such commands typically generate the following code (depending on the assembly language syntax):\n  // Translation of x=foo[j] or x=*(foo+j);\n  ADD R1,foo,j    // R1  Flow of Control While programs normally execute in a linear fashion, one command after the other, they also include occasional branches to locations other than the next command. Branching serves several purposes including repetition (jump backward to the beginning of a loop), conditional execution (if a Boolean condition is false, jump forward to the location after the “if-then” clause), and subroutine calling (jump to the first command of some other code segment). In order to support these programming constructs, every machine language features the means to jump to selected locations in the program, both conditionally and unconditionally. In assembly languages, locations in the program can also be given symbolic names, using some syntax for specifying labels. Figure 4.1 illustrates a typical example.\n\n\n  Figure 4.1 High- and low-level branching logic. The syntax of goto commands varies from one language to another, but the basic idea is the same.\n  Unconditional jump commands like JMP beginWhile specify only the address of the target location. Conditional jump commands like JNG R1,endWhile must also specify a Boolean condition, expressed in some way. In some languages the condition is an explicit part of the command, while in others it is a by- product of executing a previous command.\n  This ends our informal introduction to machine languages and the generic operations that they normally support. The next section gives a formal description of one specific machine language—the native code of the computer that we will build in chapter 5.\n"},"chapter04/02-Hack_Machine_Language_Specification.html":{"url":"chapter04/02-Hack_Machine_Language_Specification.html","title":"2.Hack Machine Language Specification","keywords":"","body":"4.2 Hack Machine Language Specification\n\n4.2.1 Overview\n  The Hack computer is a von Neumann platform. It is a 16-bit machine, consisting of a CPU, two separate memory modules serving as instruction memory and data memory, and two memory-mapped I/O devices: a screen and a keyboard.\n  Memory Address Spaces The Hack programmer is aware of two distinct address spaces: an instruction memory and a data memory. Both memories are 16-bit wide and have a 15-bit address space, meaning that the maximum addressable size of each memory is 32K 16-bit words.\n  The CPU can only execute programs that reside in the instruction memory. The instruction memory is a read-only device, and programs are loaded into it using some exogenous means. For example, the instruction memory can be implemented in a ROM chip that is pre-burned with the required program. Loading a new program is done by replacing the entire ROM chip, similar to replacing a cartridge in a game console. In order to simulate this operation, hardware simulators of the Hack platform must provide a means to load the instruction memory from a text file containing a machine language program.\n  Registers The Hack programmer is aware of two 16-bit registers called D and A. These registers can be manipulated explicitly by arithmetic and logical instructions like A=D-1 or D=!A (where “!” means a 16- bit Not operation). While D is used solely to store data values, A doubles as both a data register and an address register. That is to say, depending on the instruction context, the contents of A can be interpreted either as a data value, or as an address in the data memory, or as an address in the instruction memory, as we now explain.\n  First, the A register can be used to facilitate direct access to the data memory (which, from now on, will be often referred to as “memory”). Since Hack instructions are 16-bit wide, and since addresses are specified using 15 bits, it is impossible to pack both an operation code and an address in one instruction. Thus, the syntax of the Hack language mandates that memory access instructions operate on an implicit memory location labeled “M”, for example, D=M+1. In order to resolve this address, the convention is that M always refers to the memory word whose address is the current value of the A register. For example, if we want to effect the operation D = Memory[516] - 1, we have to use one instruction to set the A register to 516, and a subsequent instruction to specify D=M-1.\n  In addition, the hardworking A register is also used to facilitate direct access to the instruction memory. Similar to the memory access convention, Hack jump instructions do not specify a particular address. Instead, the convention is that any jump operation always effects a jump to the instruction located in the memory word addressed by A. Thus, if we want to effect the operation goto 35, we use one instruction to set A to 35, and a second instruction to code a goto command, without specifying an address. This sequence causes the computer to fetch the instruction located in InstructionMemory[35] in the next clock cycle.\n  Example Since the Hack language is self-explanatory, we start with an example. The only non-obvious command in the language is @value, where value is either a number or a symbol representing a number. This command simply stores the specified value in the A register. For example, if sum refers to memory location 17, then both @17 and @sum will have the same effect: A←17.\n  And now to the example: Suppose we want to add the integers 1 to 100, using repetitive addition. Figure 4.2 gives a C language solution and a possible compilation into the Hack language.\n  Although the Hack syntax is more accessible than that of most machine languages, it may still look obscure to readers who are not familiar with low-level programming. In particular, note that every operation involving a memory location requires two Hack commands: One for selecting the address on which we want to operate, and one for specifying the desired operation. Indeed, the Hack language consists of two generic instructions: an address instruction, also called A-instruction, and a compute instruction, also called C-instruction. Each instruction has a binary representation, a symbolic representation, and an effect on the computer, as we now specify.\n4.2.2 The A-Instruction\n  The A-instruction is used to set the A register to a 15-bit value:\n\n\n  This instruction causes the computer to store the specified value in the A register. For example, the instruction @ 5, which is equivalent to 0000000000000101, causes the computer to store the binary representation of 5 in the A register.\n  The A-instruction is used for three different purposes. First, it provides the only way to enter a constant into the computer under program control. Second, it sets the stage for a subsequent C-instruction designed to manipulate a certain data memory location, by first setting A to the address of that location. Third, it sets the stage for a subsequent C-instruction that specifies a jump, by first loading the address of the jump destination to the A register. These uses are demonstrated in figure 4.2.\n\n\n  Figure 4.2 C and assembly versions of the same program. The infinite loop at the program’s end is our standard way to “terminate” the execution of Hack programs.\n4.2.3 The C-Instruction\n  The C-Instruction is the programming workhorse of the Hack platform—the instruction that gets almost everything done. The instruction code is a specification that answers three questions: (a) what to compute, (b) where to store the computed value, and (c) what to do next? Along with the A-Instruction, these specifications determine all the possible operations of the computer.\n\n\n  The leftmost bit is the C-Instruction code, which is 1. The next two bits are not used. The remaining bits form three fields that correspond to the three parts of the instruction’s symbolic representation. The overall semantics of the symbolic instruction dest = comp;jump is as follows. The comp field instructs the ALU what to compute. The dest field instructs where to store the computed value (ALU output). The jump field specifies a jump condition, namely, which command to fetch and execute next. We now describe the format and semantics of each of the three fields.\n  The Computation Specification The Hack ALU is designed to compute a fixed set of functions on the D, A, and M registers (where M stands for Memory[A]). The computed function is specified by the a-bit and the six c-bits comprising the instruction’s comp field. This 7-bit pattern can potentially code 128 different functions, of which only the 28 listed in figure 4.3 are documented in the language specification.\n  Recall that the format of the C-Instruction is 111a cccc ccdd djjj. Suppose we want to have the ALU compute D-1, the current value of the D register minus 1. According to figure 4.3, this can be done by issuing the instruction 1110 0011 1000 0000 (the 7-bit operation code is in bold). To compute the value of D|M, we issue the instruction 1111 0101 0100 0000. To compute the constant-1, we issue the instruction 1110 1110 1000 0000, and so on.\n  The Destination Specification The value computed by the comp part of the C-Instruction can be stored in several destinations, as specified by the instruction’s 3-bit dest part (see figure 4.4). The first and second d-bits code whether to store the computed value in the A register and in the D register, respectively. The third d-bit codes whether to store the computed value in M (i.e., in Memory[A]). One, more than one, or none of these bits may be asserted.\n\n\n  Figure 4.3 The compute field of the C-Instruction. D and A are names of registers. M refers to the memory location addressed by A, namely, to Memory[A]. The symbols + and - denote 16-bit 2’s complement addition and subtraction, while !, |, and & denote the 16-bit bit-wise Boolean operators Not, Or, and And, respectively. Note the similarity between this instruction set and the ALU specification given in figure 2.6.\n  **Recall that the format of the C-Instruction is 111a cccc ccdd djjj. Suppose we want the computer to increment the value of Memory[7] by 1 and to also store the result in the D register. According to figures 4.3 and 4.4, this can be accomplished by the following instructions:\n\n\n  Figure 4.4 The dest field of the C-Instruction.\n  The first instruction causes the computer to select the memory register whose address is 7 (the so- called M register). The second instruction computes the value of M + 1 and stores the result in both M and D.\n  The Jump Specification The jump field of the C-Instruction tells the computer what to do next. There are two possibilities: The computer should either fetch and execute the next instruction in the program, which is the default, or it should fetch and execute an instruction located elsewhere in the program. In the latter case, we assume that the A register has been previously set to the address to which we have to jump.\n  Whether or not a jump should actually materialize depends on the three j-bits of the jump field and on the ALU output value (computed according to the comp field). The first j-bit specifies whether to jump in case this value is negative, the second j-bit in case the value is zero, and the third j-bit in case it is positive. This gives eight possible jump conditions, shown in figure 4.5.\n  The following example illustrates the jump commands in action:\n\n\n  Figure 4.5 The jump field of the C-Instruction. Out refers to the ALU output (resulting from the instruction’s comp part), and jump implies “continue execution with the instruction addressed by the A register.”\n  The last instruction (0; JMP) effects an unconditional jump. Since the C-Instruction syntax requires that we always effect some computation, we instruct the ALU to compute 0 (an arbitrary choice), which is ignored.\n  Conflicting Uses of the A Register As was just illustrated, the programmer can use the A register to select either a data memory location for a subsequent C-Instruction involving M, or an instruction memory location for a subsequent C-Instruction involving a jump. Thus, to prevent conflicting use of the A register, in well-written programs a C-Instruction that may cause a jump (i.e., with some non-zero j bits) should not contain a reference to M, and vice versa.\n4.2.4 Symbols\n  Assembly commands can refer to memory locations (addresses) using either constants or symbols. Symbols are introduced into assembly programs in the following three ways:\n  ■ Predefined symbols: A special subset of RAM addresses can be referred to by any assembly program using the following predefined symbols:\n    ● Virtual registers: To simplify assembly programming, the symbols R0 to R15 are predefined to refer to RAM addresses 0 to 15, respectively.\n    ● Predefined pointers: The symbols SP, LCL, ARG, THIS, and THAT are predefined to refer to RAM addresses 0 to 4, respectively. Note that each of these memory locations has two labels. For example, address 2 can be referred to using either R2 or ARG. This syntactic convention will come to play in the implementation of the virtual machine, discussed in chapters 7 and 8.\n    ● I/O pointers: The symbols SCREEN and KBD are predefined to refer to RAM addresses 16384 (0x4000) and 24576 (0x6000), respectively, which are the base addresses of the screen and keyboard memory maps. The use of these I/O devices is explained later.\n  ■ Label symbols: These user-defined symbols, which serve to label destinations of goto commands, are declared by the pseudo-command “(Xxx)”. This directive defines the symbol Xxx to refer to the instruction memory location holding the next command in the program. A label can be defined only once and can be used anywhere in the assembly program, even before the line in which it is defined.\n  ■ Variable symbols: Any user-defined symbol Xxx appearing in an assembly program that is not predefined and is not defined elsewhere using the “(Xxx)” command is treated as a variable, and is assigned a unique memory address by the assembler, starting at RAM address 16 (0x0010).\n4.2.5 Input/Output Handling\n  The Hack platform can be connected to two peripheral devices: a screen and a keyboard. Both devices interact with the computer platform through memory maps. This means that drawing pixels on the screen is achieved by writing binary values into a memory segment associated with the screen. Likewise, listening to the keyboard is done by reading a memory location associated with the keyboard. The physical I/O devices and their memory maps are synchronized via continuous refresh loops.\n  Screen The Hack computer includes a black-and-white screen organized as 256 rows of 512 pixels per row. The screen’s contents are represented by an 8K memory map that starts at RAM address 16384 (0x4000). Each row in the physical screen, starting at the screen’s top left corner, is represented in the RAM by 32 consecutive 16-bit words. Thus the pixel at row r from the top and column c from the left is mapped on the c%16 bit (counting from LSB to MSB) of the word located at RAM[16384 + r · 32 + c/16]. To write or read a pixel of the physical screen, one reads or writes the corresponding bit in the RAM-resident memory map (1 = black, 0 = white). Example:\n// Draw a single black dot at the screen's top left corner:\n@SCREEN   // Set the A register to point to the memory\n          // word that is mapped to the 16 left-most\n          // pixels of the top row of the screen.\nM=1       // Blacken the left-most pixel.\n  Keyboard The Hack computer interfaces with the physical keyboard via a single-word memory map located in RAM address 24576 (0x6000). Whenever a key is pressed on the physical keyboard, its 16-bit ASCII code appears in RAM[24576]. When no key is pressed, the code 0 appears in this location. In addition to the usual ASCII codes, the Hack keyboard recognizes the keys shown in figure 4.6.\n4.2.6 Syntax Conventions and File Format\n  Binary Code Files A binary code file is composed of text lines. Each line is a sequence of sixteen “0” and “1” ASCII characters, coding a single machine language instruction. Taken together, all the lines in the file represent a machine language program. The contract is such that when a machine language program is loaded into the computer’s instruction memory, the binary code represented by the file’s nth line is stored in address n of the instruction memory (the count of both program lines and memory addresses starts at 0). By convention, machine language programs are stored in text files with a “hack” extension, for example, Prog. hack.\n  Assembly Language Files By convention, assembly language programs are stored in text files with an “asm” extension, for example, Prog.asm. An assembly language file is composed of text lines, each representing either an instruction or a symbol declaration:\n\n\n  Figure 4.6 Special keyboard codes in the Hack platform.\n  ■ Instruction: an A-instruction or a C-instruction.\n  ■ (Symbol): This pseudo-command causes the assembler to assign the label Symbol to the memory location in which the next command of the program will be stored. It is called “pseudo-command” since it generates no machine code.\n  (The remaining conventions in this section pertain to assembly programs only.)\n  Constants and Symbols Constants must be non-negative and are always written in decimal notation. A user-defined symbol can be any sequence of letters, digits, underscore (_), dot (.), dollar sign ($), and colon (:) that does not begin with a digit.\n  Comments Text beginning with two slashes (//) and ending at the end of the line is considered a comment and is ignored.\n  White Space Space characters are ignored. Empty lines are ignored.\n  Case Conventions All the assembly mnemonics must be written in uppercase. The rest (user-defined labels and variable names) is case sensitive. The convention is to use uppercase for labels and lowercase for variable names.\n"},"chapter04/03-Perspective.html":{"url":"chapter04/03-Perspective.html","title":"3.Perspective","keywords":"","body":"4.3 Perspective\n\n  The Hack machine language is almost as simple as machine languages get. Most computers have more instructions, more data types, more registers, more instruction formats, and more addressing modes. However, any feature not supported by the Hack machine language may still be implemented in software, at a performance cost. For example, the Hack platform does not supply multiplication and division as primitive machine language operations. Since these operations are obviously required by any high-level language, we will later implement them at the operating system level (chapter 12).\n  In terms of syntax, we have chosen to give Hack a somewhat different look-and-feel than the mechanical nature of most assembly languages. In particular, we have chosen a high-level language-like syntax for the C-command, for example, D=M and D=D+M instead of the more traditional LOAD and ADD directives. The reader should note, however, that these are just syntactic details. For example, the + character plays no algebraic role whatsoever in the command D=D+M. Rather, the three-character string D+M, taken as a whole, is treated as a single assembly mnemonic, designed to code a single ALU operation.\n  One of the main characteristics that gives machine languages their particular flavor is the number of memory addresses that can appear in a single command. In this respect, Hack may be described as a “address machine”: Since there is no room to pack both an instruction code and a 15-bit address in the 16-bit instruction format, operations involving memory access will normally be specified in Hack using two instructions: an A-instruction to specify the address and a C-instruction to specify the operation. In comparison, most machine languages can directly specify at least one address in every machine instruction.\n  Indeed, Hack assembly code typically ends up being (mostly) an alternating sequence of A- and C- instructions, for example, @xxx followed by D=D+M, @YYY followed by 0 ; JMP, and so on. If you find this coding style tedious or even peculiar, you should note that friendlier macro commands like D=D+M[xxx] and GOTO YYY can easily be introduced into the language, causing Hack assembly code to be more readable as well as about 50 percent shorter. The trick is to have the assembler translate these macro commands into binary code effecting @xxx followed by D=D+M,@YYY followed by 0 ; JMP, and so on.\n  The assembler, mentioned several times in this chapter, is the program responsible for translating symbolic assembly programs into executable programs written in binary code. In addition, the assembler is responsible for managing all the system- and user-defined symbols found in the assembly program, and for replacing them with physical memory addresses, as needed. We return to this translation task in chapter 6, in which we build an assembler for the Hack language.\n"},"chapter04/04-Project.html":{"url":"chapter04/04-Project.html","title":"4.Project","keywords":"","body":"4.4 Project\n\n  Objective Get a taste of low-level programming in machine language, and get acquainted with the Hack computer platform. In the process of working on this project, you will also become familiar with the assembly process, and you will appreciate visually how the translated binary code executes on the target hardware.\n  Resources In this project you will use two tools supplied with the book: An assembler, designed to translate Hack assembly programs into binary code, and a CPU emulator, designed to run binary programs on a simulated Hack platform.\n  Contract Write and test the two programs described in what follows. When executed on the CPU emulator, your programs should generate the results mandated by the test scripts supplied in the project directory.\n  ■ Multiplication Program (Mult.asm): The inputs of this program are the current values stored in R0 and R1 (i.e., the two top RAM locations). The program computes the product R0*R1 and stores the result in R2. We assume (in this program) that R0>=0, R1>=0, and R0*R1\n  ■ I/O-Handling Program (Fill.asm): This program runs an infinite loop that listens to the keyboard input. When a key is pressed (any key), the program blackens the screen, namely, writes “black” in every pixel. When no key is pressed, the screen should be cleared. You may choose to blacken and clear the screen in any spatial order, as long as pressing a key continuously for long enough will result in a fully blackened screen and not pressing any key for long enough will result in a cleared screen. This program has a test script (Fill.tst) but no compare file—it should be checked by visibly inspecting the simulated screen.\n  Steps We recommend proceeding as follows:\n    0. The assembler and CPU emulator programs needed for this project are available in the tools directory of the book’s software suite. Before using them, go through the assembler tutorial and the CPU emulator tutorial.\n    1. Use a plain text editor to write the first program in assembly, and save it as projects/04/mult/Mult.asm.\n    2. Use the supplied assembler (in either batch or interactive mode) to translate your program. If you get syntax errors, go to step 1. If there are no syntax errors, the assembler will produce a file called projects/04/mult/Mult.hack, containing binary machine instructions.\n    3. Use the supplied CPU emulator to test the resulting Mult.hack code. This can be done either interactively, or batch-style using the supplied Mult.tst script. If you get run-time errors, go to step 1.\n    4. Repeat stages 1-3 for the second program (Fill.asm), using the projects/04/ fill directory.\n\n\n  Figure 4.7 The visual assembler supplied with the book.\n  Debugging Tip The Hack language is case sensitive. A common error occurs when one writes, say, @foo and @Foo in different parts of the program, thinking that both commands refer to the same variable. In fact, the assembler treats these symbols as two completely different identifiers.\n  The Supplied Assembler The book’s software suite includes a Hack assembler that can be used in either command mode or GUI mode. The latter mode of operation allows observing the translation process in a visual and step-wise fashion, as shown in figure 4.7.\n  The machine language programs produced by the assembler can be tested in two different ways. First, one can run the .hack program in the CPU emulator. Alternatively, one can run the same program directly on the hardware, by loading it into the computer’s instruction memory using the hardware simulator. Since we will finish building the hardware platform only in the next chapter, the former option makes more sense at this stage.\n\n\n  Figure 4.8 The CPU emulator supplied with the book. The loaded program can be displayed either in symbolic notation (as shown in this screen shot) or in binary code. The screen and the keyboard are not used by this particular program.\n  The Supplied CPU Emulator This program simulates the Hack computer platform. It allows loading a Hack program into the simulated ROM and visually observing its execution on the simulated hardware, as shown in figure 4.8.\n  For ease of use, the CPU emulator enables loading binary .hack files as well as symbolic .asm files. In the latter case, the emulator translates the assembly program into binary code on the fly. This utility seems to render the supplied assembler unnecessary, but this is not the case. First, the supplied assembler shows the translation process visually, for instructive purposes. Second, the binary files generated by the assembler can be executed directly on the hardware platform. To do so, load the Computer chip (built in chapter 5’s project) into the hardware simulator, then load the .hack file generated by the assembler into the computer’s ROM chip.\n"},"chapter05/00-Computer_Architecture.html":{"url":"chapter05/00-Computer_Architecture.html","title":"05.

We are now ready to take all the chips that we built in chapters 1-3 and integrate them into a general-purpose computer capable of running stored programs written in the machine language presented in chapter 4. The specific computer we will build, called Hack, has two important virtues. On the one hand, Hack is a simple machine that can be constructed in just a few hours, using previously built chips and the hardware simulator supplied with the book. On the other hand, Hack is sufficiently powerful to illustrate the key operating principles and hardware elements of any digital computer. Therefore, building it will give you an excellent understanding of how modern computers work at the low hardware and software levels.\n  Following an introduction of the stored program concept, section 5.1 gives a detailed description of the von Neumann architecture—a central dogma in computer science underlying the design of almost all modern computers. The Hack platform is one example of a von Neumann machine, and section 5.2 gives its exact hardware specification. Section 5.3 describes how the Hack platform can be implemented from available chips, in particular the ALU built in chapter 2 and the registers and memory systems built in chapter 3.\n  The computer that will emerge from this construction will be as simple as possible, but not simpler. This means that it will have the minimal configuration necessary to run interesting programs and deliver a reasonable performance. The comparison of this machine to typical computers is taken up in section 5.4, which emphasizes the critical role that optimization plays in the design of industrial-strength computers, but not in this chapter. As usual, the simplicity of our approach has a purpose: All the chips mentioned in the chapter, culminating in the Hack computer itself, can be built and tested on a personal computer running our hardware simulator, following the technical instructions given in section 5.5. The result will be a minimal yet surprisingly powerful computer.\n"},"chapter05/01-Background.html":{"url":"chapter05/01-Background.html","title":"1.Background","keywords":"","body":"5.1 Background\n\n5.1.1 The Stored Program Concept\n  Compared to all the other machines around us, the most unique feature of the digital computer is its amazing versatility. Here is a machine with finite hardware that can perform a practically infinite array of tasks, from interactive games to word processing to scientific calculations. This remarkable flexibility—a boon that we have come to take for granted—is the fruit of a brilliant idea called the stored program concept. Formulated independently by several mathematicians in the 1930s, the stored program concept is still considered the most profound invention in, if not the very foundation of, modern computer science.\n  Like many scientific breakthroughs, the basic idea is rather simple. The computer is based on a fixed hardware platform, capable of executing a fixed repertoire of instructions. At the same time, these instructions can be used and combined like building blocks, yielding arbitrarily sophisticated programs. Moreover, the logic of these programs is not embedded in the hardware, as it was in mechanical computers predating 1930. Instead, the program’s code is stored and manipulated in the computer memory, just like data, becoming what is known as “software.” Since the computer’s operation manifests itself to the user through the currently executing software, the same hardware platform can be made to behave completely differently each time it is loaded with a different program.\n5.1.2 The von Neumann Architecture\n  The stored program concept is a key element of many abstract and practical computer models, most notably the universal Turing machine (1936) and the von Neumann machine (1945). The Turing machine —an abstract artifact describing a deceptively simple computer—is used mainly to analyze the logical foundations of computer systems. In contrast, the von Neumann machine is a practical architecture and the conceptual blueprint of almost all computer platforms today.\n\n\n  Figure 5.1 The von Neumann architecture (conceptual). At this level of detail, this model describes the architecture of almost all digital computers. The program that operates the computer resides in its memory, in accordance with the “stored program” concept.\n  The von Neumann architecture is based on a central processing unit (CPU), interacting with a memory device, receiving data from some input device, and sending data to some output device (figure 5.1). At the heart of this architecture lies the stored program concept: The computer’s memory stores not only the data that the computer manipulates, but also the very instructions that tell the computer what to do. Let us explore this architecture in some detail.\n5.1.3 Memory\n  The memory of a von Neumann machine holds two types of information: data items and programming instructions. The two types of information are usually treated differently, and in some computers they are stored in separate memory units. In spite of their different functions though, both types of information are represented as binary numbers that are stored in the same generic random-access structure: a continuous array of cells of some fixed width, also called words or locations, each having a unique address. Hence, an individual word (representing either a data item or an instruction) is specified by supplying its address.\n  Data Memory High-level programs manipulate abstract artifacts like variables, arrays, and objects. When translated into machine language, these data abstractions become series of binary numbers, stored in the computer’s data memory. Once an individual word has been selected from the data memory by specifying its address, it can be either read or written to. In the former case, we retrieve the word’s value. In the latter case, we store a new value into the selected location, erasing the old value.\n  Instruction Memory When translated into machine language, each high-level command becomes a series of binary words, representing machine language instructions. These instructions are stored in the computer’s instruction memory. In each step of the computer’s operation, the CPU fetches (i.e., reads) a word from the instruction memory, decodes it, executes the specified instruction, and figures out which instruction to execute next. Thus, changing the contents of the instruction memory has the effect of completely changing the computer’s operation.\n  The instructions that reside in the instruction memory are written in an agreed-upon formalism called machine language. In some computers, the specification of each operation and the codes representing its operands are represented in a single-word instruction. Other computers split this specification over several words.\n5.1.4 Central Processing Unit\n  The CPU—the centerpiece of the computer’s architecture—is in charge of executing the instructions of the currently loaded program. These instructions tell the CPU to carry out various calculations, to read and write values from and into the memory, and to conditionally jump to execute other instructions in the program. The CPU executes these tasks using three main hardware elements: an Arithmetic-Logic Unit (ALU), a set of registers, and a control unit.\n  Arithmetic Logic Unit The ALU is built to perform all the low-level arithmetic and logical operations featured by the computer. For instance, a typical ALU can add two numbers, test whether a number is positive, manipulate the bits in a word of data, and so on.\n  Registers The CPU is designed to carry out simple calculations quickly. In order to boost performance, it is desirable to store the results of these calculations locally, rather than ship them in and out of memory. Thus, every CPU is equipped with a small set of high-speed registers, each capable of holding a single word.\n  Control Unit A computer instruction is represented as a binary code, typically 16, 32, or 64 bits wide. Before such an instruction can be executed, it must be decoded, and the information embedded in it must be used to signal various hardware devices (ALU, registers, memory) how to execute the instruction. The instruction decoding is done by some control unit, which is also responsible for figuring out which instruction to fetch and execute next.\n  The CPU operation can now be described as a repeated loop: fetch an instruction (word) from memory; decode it; execute it, fetch the next instruction, and so on. The instruction execution may involve one or more of the following micro tasks: have the ALU compute some value, manipulate internal registers, read a word from the memory, and write a word to the memory. In the process of executing these tasks, the CPU also figures out which instruction to fetch and execute next.\n5.1.5 Registers\n  Memory access is a slow affair. When the CPU is instructed to retrieve the contents of address j of the memory, the following process ensues: (a) j travels from the CPU to the RAM; (b) the RAM’s direct- access logic selects the memory register whose address is j; (c) the contents of RAM[j] travel back to the CPU. Registers provide the same service—data retrieval and storage—without the round-trip travel and search expenses. First, the registers reside physically inside the CPU chip, so accessing them is almost instantaneous. Second, there are typically only a handful of registers, compared to millions of memory cells. Therefore, machine language instructions can specify which registers they want to manipulate using just a few bits, resulting in thinner instruction formats.\n  Different CPUs employ different numbers of registers, of different types, for different purposes. In some computer architectures each register can serve more than one purpose:\n  Data registers: These registers give the CPU short-term memory services. For example, when calculating the value of (a - b) · c, we must first compute and remember the value of (a - b). Although this result can be temporarily stored in some memory location, a better solution is to store it locally inside the CPU—in a data register.\n  Addressing registers: The CPU has to continuously access the memory in order to read data and write data. In every one of these operations, we must specify which individual memory word has to be accessed, namely, supply an address. In some cases this address appears as part of the current instruction, while in others it depends on the execution of a previous instruction. In the latter case, the address should be stored in a register whose contents can be later treated as a memory address—an addressing register.\n  Program counter register: When executing a program, the CPU must always keep track of the address of the next instruction that must be fetched from the instruction memory. This address is kept in a special register called program counter, or PC. The contents of the PC are then used as the address for fetching instructions from the instruction memory. Thus, in the process of executing the current instruction, the CPU updates the PC in one of two ways. If the current instruction contains no goto directive, the PC is incremented to point to the next instruction in the program. If the current instruction includes a goto n directive that should be executed, the CPU loads n into the PC.\n5.1.6 Input and Output\n  Computers interact with their external environments using a diverse array of input and output (I/O) devices. These include screens, keyboards, printers, scanners, network interface cards, CD-ROMs, and so forth, not to mention the bewildering array of proprietary components that embedded computers are called to control in automobiles, weapon systems, medical equipment, and so on. There are two reasons why we do not concern ourselves here with the anatomy of these various devices. First, every one of them represents a unique piece of machinery requiring a unique knowledge of engineering. Second, and for this very same reason, computer scientists have devised various schemes to make all these devices look exactly the same to the computer. The simplest trick in this art is called memory-mapped I/O.\n  The basic idea is to create a binary emulation of the I/O device, making it “look” to the CPU like a normal memory segment. In particular, each I/O device is allocated an exclusive area in memory, becoming its “memory map.” In the case of an input device (keyboard, mouse, etc.), the memory map is made to continuously reflect the physical state of the device; in the case of an output device (screen, speakers, etc.), the memory map is made to continuously drive the physical state of the device. When external events affect some input devices (e.g., pressing a key on the keyboard or moving the mouse), certain values are written in their respective memory maps. Likewise, if we want to manipulate some output devices (e.g., draw something on the screen or play a tune), we write some values in their respective memory maps. From the hardware point of view, this scheme requires each I/O device to provide an interface similar to that of a memory unit. From a software point of view, each I/O device is required to define an interaction contract, so that programs can access it correctly. As a side comment, given the multitude of available computer platforms and I/O devices, one can appreciate the crucial role that standards play in designing computer architectures.\n  The practical implications of a memory-mapped I/O architecture are significant: The design of the CPU and the overall platform can be totally independent of the number, nature, or make of the I/O devices that interact, or will interact, with the computer. Whenever we want to connect a new I/O device to the computer, all we have to do is allocate to it a new memory map and “take note” of its base address (these one-time configurations are typically done by the operating system). From this point onward, any program that wants to manipulate this I/O device can do so—all it needs to do is manipulate bits in memory.\n"},"chapter05/02-The_Hack_Hardware_Platform_Specification.html":{"url":"chapter05/02-The_Hack_Hardware_Platform_Specification.html","title":"2.The Hack Hardware Platform Specification","keywords":"","body":"5.2 The Hack Hardware Platform Specification\n\n5.2.1 Overview\n  The Hack platform is a 16-bit von Neumann machine, consisting of a CPU, two separate memory modules serving as instruction memory and data memory, and two memory-mapped I/O devices: a screen and a keyboard. Certain parts of this architecture—especially its machine language—were presented in chapter 4. A summary of this discussion is given here, for ease of reference.\n  The Hack computer executes programs that reside in its instruction memory. The instruction memory is a read-only device, and thus programs are loaded into it using some exogenous means. For example, the instruction memory can be implemented in a ROM chip that is preburned with the required program. Loading a new program can be done by replacing the entire ROM chip. In order to simulate this operation, hardware simulators of the Hack platform must provide a means for loading the instruction memory from a text file containing a program written in the Hack machine language. (From now on, we will refer to Hack’s data memory and instruction memory as RAM and ROM, respectively.)\n  The Hack CPU consists of the ALU specified in chapter 2 and three registers called data register (D), address register (A), and program counter (PC). D and A are general-purpose 16-bit registers that can be manipulated by arithmetic and logical instructions like A=D-1, D=D|A, and so on, following the Hack machine language specified in chapter 4. While the D-register is used solely to store data values, the contents of the A-register can be interpreted in three different ways, depending on the instruction’s context: as a data value, as a RAM address, or as a ROM address.\n  The Hack machine language is based on two 16-bit command types. The address instruction has the format 0vvvvvvvvvvvvvvv, each v being 0 or 1. This instruction causes the computer to load the 15-bit constant vvv...v into the A-register. The compute instruction has the format 111accccccdddjjj. The a- and c-bits instruct the ALU which function to compute, the d-bits instruct where to store the ALU output, and the j-bits specify an optional jump condition, all according to the Hack machine language specification.\n  The computer architecture is wired in such a way that the output of the program counter (PC) chip is connected to the address input of the ROM chip. This way, the ROM chip always emits the word ROM[PC], namely, the contents of the instruction memory location whose address is “pointed at” by the PC. This value is called the current instruction. With that in mind, the overall computer operation during each clock cycle is as follows:\n  Execute: Various bit parts of the current instruction are simultaneously fed to various chips in the computer. If it’s an address instruction (most significant bit = 0), the A-register is set to the 15-bit constant embedded in the instruction. If it’s a compute instruction (MSB = 1), its underlying a-, c-, d- and j-bits are treated as control bits that cause the ALU and the registers to execute the instruction.\n  Fetch: Which instruction to fetch next is determined by the jump bits of the current instruction and by the ALU output. Taken together, these values determine whether a jump should materialize. If so, the PC is set to the value of the A-register; otherwise, the PC is incremented by 1. In the next clock cycle, the instruction that the program counter points at emerges from the ROM’s output, and the cycle continues.\n  This particular fetch-execute cycle implies that in the Hack platform, elementary operations involving memory access usually require two instructions: an address instruction to set the A register to a particular address, and a subsequent compute instruction that operates on this address (a read/write operation on the RAM or a jump operation into the ROM).\n  We now turn to formally specify the Hack hardware platform. Before starting, we wish to point out that this platform can be assembled from previously built components. The CPU is based on the ALU built in chapter 2. The registers and the program counter are identical copies of the 16-bit register and 16-bit counter, respectively, built in chapter 3. Likewise, the ROM and the RAM chips are versions of the memory units built in chapter 3. Finally, the screen and the keyboard devices will interface with the hardware platform through memory maps, implemented as built-in chips that have the same interface as RAM chips.\n5.2.2 Central Processing Unit (CPU)\n  The CPU of the Hack platform is designed to execute 16-bit instructions according to the Hack machine language specified in chapter 4. It expects to be connected to two separate memory modules: an instruction memory, from which it fetches instructions for execution, and a data memory, from which it can read, and into which it can write, data values. Figure 5.2 gives the specification details.\n\n\n  Figure 5.2 The Central Processing Unit. Assembled from the ALU and the registers built in chapters 2 and 3, respectively.\n5.2.3 Instruction Memory\n  The Hack instruction memory is implemented in a direct-access Read-Only Memory device, also called ROM. The Hack ROM consists of 32K addressable 16-bit registers, as shown in figure 5.3.\n\n\n  Figure 5.3 Instruction memory.\n5.2.4 Data Memory\n  Hack’s data memory chip has the interface of a typical RAM device, like that built in chapter 3 (see, e.g., figure 3.3). To read the contents of register n, we put n in the memory’s address input and probe the memory’s out output. This is a combinational operation, independent of the clock. To write a value v into register n, we put v in the in input, n in the address input, and assert the memory’s load bit. This is a sequential operation, and so register n will commit to the new value v in the next clock cycle.\n  In addition to serving as the computer’s general-purpose data store, the data memory also interfaces between the CPU and the computer’s input/output devices, using memory maps.\n  Memory Maps In order to facilitate interaction with a user, the Hack platform can be connected to two peripheral devices: screen and keyboard. Both devices interact with the computer platform through memory-mapped buffers. Specifically, screen images can be drawn and probed by writing and reading, respectively, words in a designated memory segment called screen memory map. Similarly, one can check which key is presently pressed on the keyboard by probing a designated memory word called keyboard memory map. The memory maps interact with their respective I/O devices via peripheral logic that resides outside the computer. The contract is as follows: Whenever a bit is changed in the screen’s memory map, a respective pixel is drawn on the physical screen. Whenever a key is pressed on the physical keyboard, the respective code of this key appears in the keyboard’s memory map.\n  We specify first the built-in chips that interface between the hardware interface and the I/O devices, then the complete memory module that embeds these chips.\n  Screen The Hack computer can interact with a black-and-white screen organized as 256 rows of 512 pixels per row. The computer interfaces with the physical screen via a memory map, implemented by a chip called Screen. This chip behaves like regular memory, meaning that it can be read and written to. In addition, it features the side effect that any bit written to it is reflected as a pixel on the physical screen (1 = black, 0 = white). The exact mapping between the memory map and the physical screen coordinates is given in figure 5.4.\n\n\n  Figure 5.4 Screen interface.\n  Keyboard The Hack computer can interact with a standard keyboard, like that of a personal computer. The computer interfaces with the physical keyboard via a chip called Keyboard (figure 5.5). Whenever a key is pressed on the physical keyboard, its 16-bit ASCII code appears as the output of the Keyboard chip. When no key is pressed, the chip outputs 0. In addition to the usual ASCII codes, the Keyboard chip recognizes, and responds to, the keys listed in figure 5.6.\n\n\n  Figure 5.5 Keyboard interface.\n\n\n  Figure 5.6 Special keyboard keys in the Hack platform.\n  Now that we’ve described the internal parts of the data memory, we are ready to specify the entire data memory address space.\n  Overall Memory The overall address space of the Hack platform (i.e., its entire data memory) is provided by a chip called Memory. The memory chip includes the RAM (for regular data storage) and the screen and keyboard memory maps. These modules reside in a single address space that is partitioned into four sections, as shown in figure 5.7.\n4.2.5 Computer\n  The topmost chip in the Hack hardware hierarchy is a complete computer system designed to execute programs written in the Hack machine language. This abstraction is described in figure 5.8. The Computer chip contains all the hardware devices necessary to operate the computer including a CPU, a data memory, an instruction memory (ROM), a screen, and a keyboard, all implemented as internal parts. In order to execute a program, the program’s code must be preloaded into the ROM. Control of the screen and the keyboard is achieved via their memory maps, as described in the Screen and Keyboard chip specifications.\n"},"chapter05/03-Implementation.html":{"url":"chapter05/03-Implementation.html","title":"3.Implementation","keywords":"","body":"5.3 Implementation\n\n  This section gives general guidelines on how the Hack computer platform can be built to deliver the various services described in its specification (section 5.2). As usual, we don’t give exact building instructions, expecting readers to come up with their own designs. All the chips can be built in HDL and simulated on a personal computer using the hardware simulator that comes with the book. As usual, technical details are given in the final Project section of this chapter.\n\n\n  Figure 5.7 Data memory.\n\n\n  Figure 5.8 Computer. Topmost chip of the Hack hardware platform.\n  Since most of the action in the Hack platform occurs in its Central Processing Unit, the main implementation challenge is building the CPU. The construction of the rest of the computer platform is straightforward.\n5.3.1 The Central Processing Unit\n  The CPU implementation objective is to create a logic gate architecture capable of executing a given Hack instruction and fetching the next instruction to be executed. Naturally, the CPU will include an ALU capable of executing Hack instructions, a set of registers, and some control logic designed to fetch and decode instructions. Since almost all these hardware elements were already built in previous chapters, the key question here is how to connect them in order to effect the desired CPU operation. One possible solution is illustrated in figure 5.9.\n\n\n  Figure 5.9 Proposed CPU implementation. The diagram shows only data and address paths, namely, wires that carry data and addresses from one place to another. The diagram does not show the CPU’s control logic, except for inputs and outputs of control bits, labeled with a circled “c”. Thus it should be viewed as an incomplete chip diagram.\n  The key element missing in figure 5.9 is the CPU’s control logic, designed to perform the following tasks:\n  ■ Instruction decoding: Figure out what the instruction means (a function of the instruction).\n  ■ Instruction execution: Signal the various parts of the computer what they should do in order to execute the instruction (a function of the instruction).\n  ■ Next instruction fetching: Figure out which instruction to execute next (a function of the instruction and the ALU output).\n  (In what follows, the term proposed CPU implementation refers to figure 5.9.)\n  Instruction Decoding The 16-bit word located in the CPU’s instruction input can represent either an A- instruction or a C-instruction. In order to figure out what this 16-bit word means, it can be broken into the fields “i xx a cccccc ddd jjj”. The i-bit codes the instruction type, which is 0 for an A-instruction and 1 for a C-instruction. In case of a C-instruction, the a-bit and the c-bits code the comp part, the d-bits code the dest part, and the j-bits code the jump part of the instruction. In case of an A-instruction, the 15 bits other than the i-bit should be interpreted as a 15-bit constant.\n  Instruction Execution The various fields of the instruction (i-, a-, c-, d-, and j-bits) are routed simultaneously to various parts of the architecture, where they cause different chips to do what they are supposed to do in order to execute either the A-instruction or the C-instruction, as mandated by the machine language specification. In particular, the a-bit determines whether the ALU will operate on the A register input or on the Memory input, the c-bits determine which function the ALU will compute, and the d-bits enable various locations to accept the ALU result.\n  Next Instruction Fetching As a side effect of executing the current instruction, the CPU also determines the address of the next instruction and emits it via its pc output. The “driver” of this task is the program counter—an internal part of the CPU whose output is fed directly to the CPU’s pc output. This is precisely the PC chip built in chapter 3 (see figure 3.5).\n  Most of the time, the programmer wants the computer to fetch and execute the next instruction in the program. Thus if t is the current time-unit, the default program counter operation should be PC(t) = PC(t - 1) + 1. When we want to effect a goto n operation, the machine language specification requires to first set the A register to n (via an A-instruction) and then issue a jump directive (coded by the j-bits of a subsequent C-instruction). Hence, our challenge is to come up with a hardware implementation of the following logic:\nIf jump(t) then PC(t) = A(t-1)\nelse PC(t) = PC(t-1) + 1\n  Conveniently, and actually by careful design, this jump control logic can be easily effected by the proposed CPU implementation. Recall that the PC chip interface (figure 3.5) has a load control bit that enables it to accept a new input value. Thus, to effect the desired jump control logic, we start by connecting the output of the A register to the input of the PC. The only remaining question is when to enable the PC to accept this value (rather than continuing its steadfast counting), namely, when does a jump need to occur. This is a function of two signals: (a) the j-bits of the current instruction, specifying on which condition we are supposed to jump, and (b) the ALU output status bits, indicating whether the condition is satisfied. If we have a jump, the PC should be loaded with A’s output. Otherwise, the PC should increment by 1.\n  Additionally, if we want the computer to restart the program’s execution, all we have to do is reset the program counter to 0. That’s why the proposed CPU implementation feeds the CPU’s reset input directly into the reset pin of the PC chip.\n5.3.2 Memory\n  According to its specification, the Memory chip of the Hack platform is essentially a package of three lower-level chips: RAM16K, Screen, and Keyboard. At the same-time, users of the Memory chip must see a single logical address space, spanning from location 0 to 24576 (0x0000 to 0x6000—see figure 5.7). The implementation of the Memory chip should create this continuum effect. This can be done by the same technique used to combine small RAM units into larger ones, as we have done in chapter 3 (see figure 3.6 and the discussion of n-register memory that accompanies it).\n5.3.3 Computer\n  Once the CPU and the Memory chips have been implemented and tested, the construction of the overall computer is straightforward. Figure 5.10 depicts a possible implementation.Once the CPU and the Memory chips have been implemented and tested, the construction of the overall computer is straightforward. Figure 5.10 depicts a possible implementation.\n\n\n  Figure 5.10 Proposed implementation of the topmost Computer chip.\n"},"chapter05/04-Perspective.html":{"url":"chapter05/04-Perspective.html","title":"4.Perspective","keywords":"","body":"5.4 Perspective\n\n  Following the general spirit of the book, the architecture of the Hack computer is rather minimal. Typical computer platforms have more registers, more data types, more powerful ALUs, and richer instruction sets. However, these differences are mainly quantitative. From a qualitative standpoint, Hack is quite similar to most digital computers, as they all follow the same conceptual paradigm: the von Neumann architecture.\n  In terms of function, computer systems can be classified into two categories: general-purpose computers, designed to easily switch from executing one program to another, and dedicated computers, usually embedded in other systems like cell phones, game consoles, digital cameras, weapon systems, factory equipment, and so on. For any particular application, a single program is burned into the dedicated computer’s ROM, and is the only one that can be executed (in game consoles, for example, the game software resides in an external cartridge that is simply a replaceable ROM module encased in some fancy package). Aside from this difference, general-purpose and dedicated computers share the same architectural ideas: stored programs, fetch-decode-execute logic, CPU, registers, program counter, and so on.\n  Unlike Hack, most general-purpose computers use a single address space for storing both data and instructions. In such architectures, the instruction address as well as the optional data address specified by the instruction must be fed into the same destination: the single address input of the shared address space. Clearly, this cannot be done at the same time. The standard solution is to base the computer implementation on a two-cycle logic. During the fetch cycle, the instruction address is fed to the address input of the memory, causing it to immediately emit the current instruction, which is then stored in an instruction register. In the subsequent execute cycle, the instruction is decoded, and the optional data address inferred from it is fed to the memory’s address input, allowing the instruction to manipulate the selected memory location. In contrast, the Hack architecture is unique in that it partitions the address space into two separate parts, allowing a single-cycle fetch-execute logic. The price of this simpler hardware design is that programs cannot be changed dynamically.\n  In terms of I/O, the Hack keyboard and screen are rather spartan. General-purpose computers are typically connected to multiple I/O devices like printers, disks, network connections, and so on. Also, typical screens are obviously much more powerful than the Hack screen, featuring more pixels, many brightness levels in each pixel, and colors. Still, the basic principle that each pixel is controlled by a memory-resident binary value is maintained: instead of a single bit controlling the pixel’s black or white color, several bits are devoted to control the level of brightness of each of the three primary colors that, together, produce the pixel’s ultimate color. Likewise, the memory mapping of the Hack screen is simplistic. Instead of mapping pixels directly into bits of memory, most modern computers allow the CPU to send high-level graphic instructions to a graphics card that controls the screen. This way, the CPU is relieved from the tedium of drawing figures like circles and polygons directly—the graphics card takes care of this task using its own embedded chip-set.\n  Finally, it should be stressed that most of the effort and creativity in designing computer hardware is invested in achieving better performance. Thus, hardware architecture courses and textbooks typically evolve around such issues as implementing memory hierarchies (cache), better access to I/O devices, pipelining, parallelism, instruction prefetching, and other optimization techniques that were sidestepped in this chapter.\n  Historically, attempts to enhance the processor’s performance have led to two main schools of hardware design. Advocates of the Complex Instruction Set Computing (CISC) approach argue for achieving better performance by providing rich and elaborate instruction sets. Conversely, the Reduced Instruction Set Computing (RISC) camp uses simpler instruction sets in order to promote as fast a hardware implementation as possible. The Hack computer does not enter this debate, featuring neither a strong instruction set nor special hardware acceleration techniques.\n"},"chapter05/05-Project.html":{"url":"chapter05/05-Project.html","title":"5.Project","keywords":"","body":"5.5 Project\n\n  Objective Build the Hack computer platform, culminating in the topmost Computer chip.\n  Resources The only tools that you need for completing this project are the hardware simulator supplied with the book and the test scripts described here. The computer platform should be implemented in the HDL language specified in appendix A.\n  Contract The computer platform built in this project should be capable of executing programs written in the Hack machine language, specified in chapter 4. Demonstrate this capability by having your Computer chip run the three programs given here.\n  Component Testing We supply test scripts and compare files for unit-testing the Memory and CPU chips in isolation. It’s important to complete the testing of these chips before building and testing the overall Computer chip.\n  Test Programs A natural way to test the overall Computer chip implementation is to have it execute some sample programs written in the Hack machine language. In order to run such a test, one can write a test script that loads the Computer chip into the hardware simulator, loads a program from an external text file into its ROM chip, and then runs the clock enough cycles to execute the program. We supply all the files necessary to run three such tests, as follows:\n    1. Add.hack: Adds the two constants 2 and 3 and writes the result in RAM[0].\n    2. Max.hack: Computes the maximum of RAM[0] and RAM[1] and writes the result in RAM[2].\n    3. Rect.hack: Draws a rectangle of width 16 pixels and length RAM[0] at the top left of the screen.\n  Before testing your Computer chip on any one of the above programs, read the test script associated with the program and be sure to understand the instructions given to the simulator. Appendix B may be a useful reference here.\n  Steps Build the computer in the following order:\n    ■ Memory: Composed from three chips: RAM16K, Screen, and Keyboard. The Screen and the Keyboard are available as built-in chips and there is no need to build them. Although the RAM16K chip was built in the project in chapter 3, we recommend using its built-in version, as it provides a debugging-friendly GUI.\n    ■ CPU: Can be composed according to the proposed implementation given in figure 5.9, using the ALU and register chips built in chapters 2 and 3, respectively. We recommend using the built-in versions of these chips, in particular ARegister and DRegister. These chips have exactly the same functionality of the Register chip specified in chapter 3, plus GUI side effects.\n    In the course of implementing the CPU, it is allowed (but not necessarily recommended) to specify and build some internal chips of your own. This is up to you. If you choose to create new chips not mentioned in the book, be sure to document and test them carefully before you plug them into the architecture.\n    ■ Instruction Memory: Use the built-in ROM32K chip.\n    ■ Computer: The topmost Computer chip can be composed from the chips mentioned earlier, using figure 5.10 as a blueprint.\n  The Hardware Simulator As in the projects in chapters 1-3, all the chips in this project (including the topmost Computer chip) can be implemented and tested using the hardware simulator supplied with the book.

The Rect program draws a rectangle of width 16 pixels and length RAM[0] at the top left of the screen. Note that the program is correct. Thus, if it does not work properly, it means that the computer platform on which it runs (Computer.hdl and/or some of its lower-level parts) is buggy.\n"},"chapter06/00-Assembler.html":{"url":"chapter06/00-Assembler.html","title":"06. Assembler","keywords":"","body":"Chapter 6: Assembler\n\n\n\n  What’s in a name? That which we call a rose by any other name would smell as sweet.\n——Shakespeare, from Romeo and Juliet\n\n\n  The first half of the book (chapters 1-5) described and built a computer’s hardware platform. The second half of the book (chapters 6-12) focuses on the computer’s software hierarchy, culminating in the development of a compiler and a basic operating system for a simple, object-based programming language. The first and most basic module in this software hierarchy is the assembler. In particular, chapter 4 presented machine languages in both their assembly and binary representations. This chapter describes how assemblers can systematically translate programs written in the former into programs written in the latter. As the chapter unfolds, we explain how to develop a Hack assembler—a program that generates binary code that can run as is on the hardware platform built in chapter 5.\n  Since the relationship between symbolic assembly commands and their corresponding binary codes is straightforward, writing an assembler (using some high-level language) is not a difficult task. One complication arises from allowing assembly programs to use symbolic references to memory addresses. The assembler is expected to manage these user-defined symbols and resolve them to physical memory addresses. This task is normally done using a symbol table—a classical data structure that comes to play in many software translation projects.\n  As usual, the Hack assembler is not an end in itself. Rather, it provides a simple and concise demonstration of the key software engineering principles used in the construction of any assembler. Further, writing the assembler is the first in the series of seven software development projects that accompany the rest of the book. Unlike the hardware projects, which were implemented in HDL, the software projects that construct the translator programs (assembler, virtual machine, and compiler) may be implemented in any programming language. In each project, we provide a language-neutral API and a detailed step-by-step test plan, along with all the necessary test programs and test scripts. Each one of these projects, beginning with the assembler, is a stand-alone module that can be developed and tested in isolation from all the other projects.\n"},"chapter06/01-Background.html":{"url":"chapter06/01-Background.html","title":"1.Background","keywords":"","body":"6.1 Background\n\n  Machine languages are typically specified in two flavors: symbolic and binary. The binary codes—for example, 110000101000000110000000000000111—represent actual machine instructions, as understood by the underlying hardware. For example, the instruction’s leftmost 8 bits can represent an operation code, say LOAD, the next 8 bits a register, say R3, and the remaining 16 bits an address, say 7. Depending on the hardware’s logic design and the agreed-upon machine language, the overall 32-bit pattern can thus cause the hardware to effect the operation “load the contents of Memory[7] into register R3.” Modern computer platforms support dozens if not hundreds of such elementary operations. Thus, machine languages can be rather complex, involving many operation codes, different memory addressing modes, and various instruction formats.\n  One way to cope with this complexity is to document machine instructions using an agreed-upon syntax, say LOAD R3,7 rather than 110000101000000110000000000000111. And since the translation from symbolic notation to binary code is straightforward, it makes sense to allow low-level programs to be written in symbolic notation and to have a computer program translate them into binary code. The symbolic language is called assembly, and the translator program assembler. The assembler parses each assembly command into its underlying fields, translates each field into its equivalent binary code, and assembles the generated codes into a binary instruction that can be actually executed by the hardware.\n  Symbols Binary instructions are represented in binary code. By definition, they refer to memory addresses using actual numbers. For example, consider a program that uses a variable to represent the weight of various things, and suppose that this variable has been mapped on location 7 in the computer’s memory. At the binary code level, instructions that manipulate the weight variable must refer to it using the explicit address 7. Yet once we step up to the assembly level, we can allow writing commands like LOAD R3,weight instead of LOAD R3,7. In both cases, the command will effect the same operation: “set R3 to the contents of Memory[7].” In a similar fashion, rather than using commands like goto 250, assembly languages allow commands like goto loop, assuming that somewhere in the program the symbol loop is made to refer to address 250. In general then, symbols are introduced into assembly programs from two sources:\n  ■ Variables: The programmer can use symbolic variable names, and the translator will “automatically” assign them to memory addresses. Note that the actual values of these addresses are insignificant, so long as each symbol is resolved to the same address throughout the program’s translation.\n  ■ Labels: The programmer can mark various locations in the program with symbols. For example, one can declare the label loop to refer to the beginning of a certain code segment. Other commands in the program can then goto loop, either conditionally or unconditionally.\n  The introduction of symbols into assembly languages suggests that assemblers must be more sophisticated than dumb text processing programs. Granted, translating agreed-upon symbols into agreed- upon binary codes is not a complicated task. At the same time, the mapping of user-defined variable names and symbolic labels on actual memory addresses is not trivial. In fact, this symbol resolution task is the first nontrivial translation challenge in our ascent up the software hierarchy from the hardware level. The following example illustrates the challenge and the common way to address it.\n  Symbol Resolution Consider figure 6.1, showing a program written in some self-explanatory low-level language. The program contains four user-defined symbols: two variable names (i and sum) and two labels (loop and end). How can we systematically convert this program into a symbol-less code?\n  We start by making two arbitrary game rules: The translated code will be stored in the computer’s memory starting at address 0, and variables will be allocated to memory locations starting at address 1024 (these rules depend on the specific target hardware platform). Next, we build a symbol table, as follows. For each new symbol xxx encountered in the source code, we add a line (xxx, n) to the symbol table, where n is the memory address associated with the symbol according to the game rules. After completing the construction of the symbol table, we use it to translate the program into its symbol-less version.\n  Note that according to the assumed game rules, variables i and sum are allocated to addresses 1024 and 1025, respectively. Of course any other two addresses will be just as good, so long as all references to i and sum in the program resolve to the same physical addresses, as indeed is the case. The remaining code is self-explanatory, except perhaps for instruction 6. This instruction terminates the program’s execution by putting the computer in an infinite loop.\n\n\n  Figure 6.1 Symbol resolution using a symbol table. The line numbers are not part of the program—they simply count all the lines in the program that represent real instructions, namely, neither comments nor label declarations. Note that once we have the symbol table in place, the symbol resolution task is straightforward.\n  Three comments are in order here. First, note that the variable allocation assumption implies that the largest program that we can run is 1,024 instructions long. Since realistic programs (like the operating system) are obviously much larger, the base address for storing variables will normally be much farther. Second, the assumption that each source command is mapped on one word may be naïve. Typically, some assembly commands (e.g., if i=101 goto end) may translate into several machine instructions and thus will end up occupying several memory locations. The translator can deal with this variance by keeping track of how many words each source command generates, then updating its “instruction memory counter” accordingly.\n  Finally, the assumption that each variable is represented by a single memory location is also naïve. Programming languages feature variables of different types, and these occupy different memory spaces on the target computer. For example, the C language data types short and double represent 16-bit and 64-bit numbers, respectively. When a C program is run on a 16-bit machine, these variables will occupy a single memory address and a block of four consecutive addresses, respectively. Thus, when allocating memory space for variables, the translator must take into account both their data types and the word width of the target hardware.\n  The Assembler Before an assembly program can be executed on a computer, it must be translated into the computer’s binary machine language. The translation task is done by a program called the assembler. The assembler takes as input a stream of assembly commands and generates as output a stream of equivalent binary instructions. The resulting code can be loaded as is into the computer’s memory and executed by the hardware.\n  We see that the assembler is essentially a text-processing program, designed to provide translation services. The programmer who is commissioned to write the assembler must be given the full documentation of the assembly syntax, on the one hand, and the respective binary codes, on the other. Following this contract—typically called machine language specification—it is not difficult to write a program that, for each symbolic command, carries out the following tasks (not necessarily in that order):\n    ■ Parse the symbolic command into its underlying fields.\n    ■ For each field, generate the corresponding bits in the machine language.\n    ■ Replace all symbolic references (if any) with numeric addresses of memory locations.\n    ■ Assemble the binary codes into a complete machine instruction.\n  Three of the above tasks (parsing, code generation, and final assembly) are rather easy to implement. The fourth task—symbols handling—is more challenging, and considered one of the main functions of the assembler. This function was described in the previous section. The next two sections specify the Hack assembly language and propose an assembler implementation for it, respectively.\n"},"chapter06/02-Hack_Assembly-to-Binary_Translatio_Specification.html":{"url":"chapter06/02-Hack_Assembly-to-Binary_Translatio_Specification.html","title":"2.Hack Assembly-to-Binary Translation Specification","keywords":"","body":"6.2 Hack Assembly-to-Binary Translation Specification\n\n  The Hack assembly language and its equivalent binary representation were specified in chapter 4. A compact and formal version of this language specification is repeated here, for ease of reference. This specification can be viewed as the contract that Hack assemblers must implement, one way or another.\n6.2.1 Syntax Conventions and File Formats\n  File Names By convention, programs in binary machine code and in assembly code are stored in text files with “hack” and “asm” extensions, respectively. Thus, a Prog.asm file is translated by the assembler into a Prog.hack file.\n  Binary Code (.hack) Files A binary code file is composed of text lines. Each line is a sequence of 16 “0” and “1” ASCII characters, coding a single 16-bit machine language instruction. Taken together, all the lines in the file represent a machine language program. When a machine language program is loaded into the computer’s instruction memory, the binary code represented by the file’s nth line is stored in address n of the instruction memory (the count of both program lines and memory addresses starts at 0).\n  Assembly Language (.asm) Files An assembly language file is composed of text lines, each representing either an instruction or a symbol declaration:\n    ■ Instruction: an A-instruction or a C-instruction, described in section 6.2.2.\n    ■ (Symbol): This pseudo-command binds the Symbol to the memory location into which the next command in the program will be stored. It is called “pseudocommand” since it generates no machine code.\n    (The remaining conventions in this section pertain to assembly programs only.)\n  Constants and Symbols Constants must be non-negative and are written in decimal notation. A user-defined symbol can be any sequence of letters, digits, underscore (_), dot (.), dollar sign ($), and colon (:) that does not begin with a digit.\n  Comments Text beginning with two slashes (//) and ending at the end of the line is considered a comment and is ignored.\n  White Space Space characters are ignored. Empty lines are ignored.\n  Case Conventions All the assembly mnemonics must be written in uppercase. The rest (user-defined labels and variable names) is case sensitive. The convention is to use uppercase for labels and lowercase for variable names.\n6.2.2 Instructions\n  The Hack machine language consists of two instruction types called addressing instruction (A-instruction) and compute instruction (C-instruction). The instruction format is as follows.\n\n\n  The translation of each of the three fields comp, dest, jump to their binary forms is specified in the following three tables.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n6.2.3 Symbols\n  Hack assembly commands can refer to memory locations (addresses) using either constants or symbols. Symbols in assembly programs arise from three sources.\n  Predefined Symbols Any Hack assembly program is allowed to use the following predefined symbols.\n\n\n  Note that each one of the top five RAM locations can be referred to using two predefined symbols. For example, either R2 or ARG can be used to refer to RAM[2].\n  Label Symbols The pseudo-command (Xxx) defines the symbol Xxx to refer to the instruction memory location holding the next command in the program. A label can be defined only once and can be used anywhere in the assembly program, even before the line in which it is defined.\n  Variable Symbols Any symbol Xxx appearing in an assembly program that is not predefined and is not defined elsewhere using the (Xxx) command is treated as a variable. Variables are mapped to consecutive memory locations as they are first encountered, starting at RAM address 16 (0x0010).\n6.2.4 Example\n  Chapter 4 presented a program that sums up the integers 1 to 100. Figure 6.2 repeats this example, showing both its assembly and binary versions.\n\n\n  Figure 6.2 Assembly and binary representations of the same program.\n"},"chapter06/03-Implementation.html":{"url":"chapter06/03-Implementation.html","title":"3.Implementation","keywords":"","body":"6.3 Implementation\n\n  The Hack assembler reads as input a text file named Prog.asm, containing a Hack assembly program, and produces as output a text file named Prog.hack, containing the translated Hack machine code. The name of the input file is supplied to the assembler as a command line argument:\n  prompt> Assembler Prog.asm\n  The translation of each individual assembly command to its equivalent binary instruction is direct and one-to-one. Each command is translated separately. In particular, each mnemonic component (field) of the assembly command is translated into its corresponding bit code according to the tables in section 6.2.2, and each symbol in the command is resolved to its numeric address as specified in section 6.2.3.\n  We propose an assembler implementation based on four modules: a Parser module that parses the input, a Code module that provides the binary codes of all the assembly mnemonics, a SymbolTable module that handles symbols, and a main program that drives the entire translation process.\n  A Note about API Notation The assembler development is the first in a series of five software construction projects that build our hierarchy of translators (assembler, virtual machine, and compiler). Since readers can develop these projects in the programming language of their choice, we base our proposed implementation guidelines on language independent APIs. A typical project API describes several modules, each containing one or more routines. In object-oriented languages like Java, C++, and C#, a module usually corresponds to a class, and a routine usually corresponds to a method. In procedural languages, routines correspond to functions, subroutines, or procedures, and modules correspond to collections of routines that handle related data. In some languages (e.g., Modula-2) a module may be expressed explicitly, in others implicitly (e.g., a file in the C language), and in others (e.g., Pascal) it will have no corresponding language construct, and will just be a conceptual grouping of routines.\n6.3.1 The Parser Module\n  The main function of the parser is to break each assembly command into its underlying components (fields and symbols). The API is as follows.\n  Parser: Encapsulates access to the input code. Reads an assembly language command, parses it, and provides convenient access to the command’s components (fields and symbols). In addition, removes all white space and comments.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n6.3.2 The Code Module\n\n\n  Code: Translates Hack assembly language mnemonics into binary codes.\n6.3.3 Assembler for Programs with No Symbols\n  We suggest building the assembler in two stages. In the first stage, write an assembler that translates assembly programs without symbols. This can be done using the Parser and Code modules just described. In the second stage, extend the assembler with symbol handling capabilities, as we explain in the next section.\n  The contract for the first symbol-less stage is that the input Prog.asm program contains no symbols. This means that (a) in all address commands of type @Xxx the Xxx constants are decimal numbers and not symbols, and (b) the input file contains no label commands, namely, no commands of type (Xxx).\n  The overall symbol-less assembler program can now be implemented as follows. First, the program opens an output file named Prog.hack. Next, the program marches through the lines (assembly instructions) in the supplied Prog.asm file. For each C-instruction, the program concatenates the translated binary codes of the instruction fields into a single 16-bit word. Next, the program writes this word into the Prog.hack file. For each A-instruction of type @Xxx, the program translates the decimal constant returned by the parser into its binary representation and writes the resulting 16-bit word into the Prog.hack file.\n6.3.4 The SymbolTable Module\n  Since Hack instructions can contain symbols, the symbols must be resolved into actual addresses as part of the translation process. The assembler deals with this task using a symbol table, designed to create and maintain the correspondence between symbols and their meaning (in Hack’s case, RAM and ROM addresses). A natural data structure for representing such a relationship is the classical hash table. In most programming languages, such a data structure is available as part of a standard library, and thus there is no need to develop it from scratch. We propose the following API.\n\n\n  SymbolTable: Keeps a correspondence between symbolic labels and numeric addresses.\n6.3.5 Assembler for Programs with Symbols\n  Assembly programs are allowed to use symbolic labels (destinations of goto commands) before the symbols are defined. This convention makes the life of assembly programmers easier and that of assembler developers harder. A common solution to this complication is to write a two-pass assembler that reads the code twice, from start to end. In the first pass, the assembler builds the symbol table and generates no code. In the second pass, all the label symbols encountered in the program have already been bound to memory locations and recorded in the symbol table. Thus, the assembler can replace each symbol with its corresponding meaning (numeric address) and generate the final binary code.\n  Recall that there are three types of symbols in the Hack language: predefined symbols, labels, and variables. The symbol table should contain and handle all these symbols, as follows.\n  Initialization Initialize the symbol table with all the predefined symbols and their pre-allocated RAM addresses, according to section 6.2.3.\n  First Pass Go through the entire assembly program, line by line, and build the symbol table without generating any code. As you march through the program lines, keep a running number recording the ROM address into which the current command will be eventually loaded. This number starts at 0 and is incremented by 1 whenever a C-instruction or an A-instruction is encountered, but does not change when a label pseudocommand or a comment is encountered. Each time a pseudocommand (Xxx) is encountered, add a new entry to the symbol table, associating Xxx with the ROM address that will eventually store the next command in the program. This pass results in entering all the program’s labels along with their ROM addresses into the symbol table. The program’s variables are handled in the second pass.\n  Second Pass Now go again through the entire program, and parse each line. Each time a symbolic A- instruction is encountered, namely, @Xxx where Xxx is a symbol and not a number, look up Xxx in the symbol table. If the symbol is found in the table, replace it with its numeric meaning and complete the command’s translation. If the symbol is not found in the table, then it must represent a new variable. To handle it, add the pair (Xxx, n) to the symbol table, where n is the next available RAM address, and complete the command’s translation. The allocated RAM addresses are consecutive numbers, starting at address 16 (just after the addresses allocated to the predefined symbols).\n  This completes the assembler’s implementation.\n"},"chapter06/04-Perspective.html":{"url":"chapter06/04-Perspective.html","title":"4.Perspective","keywords":"","body":"6.4 Perspective\n\n  Like most assemblers, the Hack assembler is a relatively simple program, dealing mainly with text processing. Naturally, assemblers for richer machine languages are more complex. Also, some assemblers feature more sophisticated symbol handling capabilities not found in Hack. For example, the assembler may allow programmers to explicitly associate symbols with particular data addresses, to perform “constant arithmetic” on symbols (e.g., to use table+5 to refer to the fifth memory location after the address referred to by table), and so on. Additionally, many assemblers are capable of handling macro commands. A macro command is simply a sequence of machine instructions that has a name. For example, our assembler can be extended to translate an agreed-upon macro-command, say D=M[xxx], into the two instructions@xxx followed immediately by D=M (xxx being an address). Clearly, such macro commands can considerably simplify the programming of commonly occurring operations, at a low translation cost.\n  We note in closing that stand-alone assemblers are rarely used in practice. First, assembly programs are rarely written by humans, but rather by compilers. And a compiler—being an automaton—does not have to bother to generate symbolic commands, since it may be more convenient to directly produce binary machine code. On the other hand, many high-level language compilers allow programmers to embed segments of assembly language code within high-level programs. This capability, which is rather common in C language compilers, gives the programmer direct control of the underlying hardware, for optimization.\n"},"chapter06/05-Project.html":{"url":"chapter06/05-Project.html","title":"5.Project","keywords":"","body":"6.5 Project\n\n  Objective Develop an assembler that translates programs written in Hack assembly language into the binary code understood by the Hack hardware platform. The assembler must implement the translation specification described in section 6.2.\n  Resources The only tool needed for completing this project is the programming language in which you will implement your assembler. You may also find the following two tools useful: the assembler and CPU emulator supplied with the book. These tools allow you to experiment with a working assembler before you set out to build one yourself. In addition, the supplied assembler provides a visual line-by-line translation GUI and allows online code comparisons with the outputs that your assembler will generate. For more information about these capabilities, refer to the assembler tutorial (part of the book’s software suite).\n  Contract When loaded into your assembler, a Prog.asm file containing a valid Hack assembly language program should be translated into the correct Hack binary code and stored in a Prog.hack file. The output produced by your assembler must be identical to the output produced by the assembler supplied with the book.\n  Building Plan We suggest building the assembler in two stages. First write a symbol-less assembler, namely, an assembler that can only translate programs that contain no symbols. Then extend your assembler with symbol handling capabilities. The test programs that we supply here come in two such versions (without and with symbols), to help you test your assembler incrementally.\n  Test Programs Each test program except the first one comes in two versions: ProgL.asm is symbol-less, and Prog.asm is with symbols.\n    Add: Adds the constants 2 and 3 and puts the result in R0.\n    Max: Computes max(R0, R1) and puts the result in R2.\n    Rect: Draws a rectangle at the top left corner of the screen. The rectangle is 16 pixels wide and R0 pixels high.\n    Pong: A single-player Ping-Pong game. A ball bounces constantly off the screen’s “walls.” The player attempts to hit the ball with a bat by pressing the left and right arrow keys. For every successful hit, the player gains one point and the bat shrinks a little to make the game harder. If the player misses the ball, the game is over. To quit the game, press ESC.\n  The Pong program was written in the Jack programming language (chapter 9) and translated into the supplied assembly program by the Jack compiler (chapters 10-11). Although the original Jack program is only about 300 lines of code, the executable Pong application is about 20,000 lines of binary code, most of which being the Jack operating system (chapter 12). Running this interactive program in the CPU emulator is a slow affair, so don’t expect a high-powered Pong game. This slowness is actually a virtue, since it enables your eye to track the graphical behavior of the program. In future projects in the book, this game will run much faster.\n  Steps Write and test your assembler program in the two stages described previously. You may use the assembler supplied with the book to compare the output of your assembler to the correct output. This testing procedure is described next. For more information about the supplied assembler, refer to the assembler tutorial.\n  The Supplied Assembler The practice of using the supplied assembler (which produces correct binary code) to test another assembler (which is not necessarily correct) is illustrated in figure 6.3. Let Prog.asm be some program written in Hack assembly. Suppose that we translate this program using the supplied assembler, producing a binary file called Prog.hack. Next, we use another assembler (e.g., the one that you wrote) to translate the same program into another file, say Prog1.hack. Now, if the latter assembler is working correctly, it follows that Prog.hack = Prog1.hack. Thus, one way to test a newly written assembler is to load Prog.asm into the supplied assembler program, load Prog1.hack as a compare file, then translate and compare the two binary files (see figure 6.3). If the comparison fails, the assembler that produced Prog1.hack must be buggy; otherwise, it may be error-free.\n\n\n  Figure 6.3 Using the supplied assembler to test the code generated by another assembler.\n"},"chapter07/00-Virtual_Machine_I_Stack_Arithmetic.html":{"url":"chapter07/00-Virtual_Machine_I_Stack_Arithmetic.html","title":"07. Virtual Machine I: Stack Arithmetic","keywords":"","body":"Chapter 7: Virtual Machine I: Stack Arithmetic\n\n\n\n  Programmers are creators of universes for which they alone are responsible. Universes of virtually unlimited complexity can be created in the form of computer programs\n——Joseph Weizenbaum, Computer Power and Human Reason (1974)\n\n\n  This chapter describes the first steps toward building a compiler for a typical object-based high-level language. We will approach this substantial task in two stages, each spanning two chapters. High-level programs will first be translated into an intermediate code (chapters 10—11), and the intermediate code will then be translated into machine language (chapters 7-8). This two-tier translation model is a rather old idea that goes back to the 1970s. Recently, it made a significant comeback following its adoption by modern languages like Java and C#.\n  The basic idea is as follows: Instead of running on a real platform, the intermediate code is designed to run on a Virtual Machine. The VM is an abstract computer that does not exist for real, but can rather be realized on other computer platforms. There are many reasons why this idea makes sense, one of which being code transportability. Since the VM may be implemented with relative ease on multiple target platforms, VM-based software can run on many processors and operating systems without having to modify the original source code. The VM implementations can be realized in several ways, by software interpreters, by special-purpose hardware, or by translating the VM programs into the machine language of the target platform.\n  This chapter presents a typical VM architecture, modeled after the Java Virtual Machine (JVM) paradigm. As usual, we focus on two perspectives. First, we motivate and specify the VM abstraction. Next, we implement it over the Hack platform. Our implementation entails writing a program called VM translator, designed to translate VM code into Hack assembly code. The software suite that comes with the book illustrates yet another implementation vehicle, called VM emulator. This program implements the VM by emulating it on a standard personal computer using Java.\n  A virtual machine model typically has a language, in which one can write VM programs. The VM language that we present here consists of four types of commands: arithmetic, memory access, program flow, and subroutine calling commands. We split the implementation of this language into two parts, each covered in a separate chapter and project. In this chapter we build a basic VM translator, capable of translating the VM’s arithmetic and memory access commands into machine language. In the next chapter we extend the basic translator with program flow and subroutine calling functionality. The result is a fullscale virtual machine that will serve as the backend of the compiler that we will build in chapters 10-11.\n  The virtual machine that emerges from this effort illustrates many important ideas in computer science. First, the notion of having one computer emulating another is a fundamental idea in the field, tracing back to Alan Turing in the 1930s. Over the years it had many practical implications, for example, using an emulator of an old generation computer running on a new platform in order to achieve upward code compatibility. More recently, the virtual machine model became the centerpiece of two competing mainstreams—the Java architecture and the .NET infrastructure. These software environments are rather complex, and one way to gain an inside view of their underlying structure is to build a simple version of their VM cores, as we do here.\n  Another important topic embedded in this chapter is stack processing. The stack is a fundamental and elegant data structure that comes to play in many computer systems and algorithms. Since the VM presented in this chapter is stack-based, it provides a working example of this remarkably versatile data structure.\n"},"chapter07/01-Background.html":{"url":"chapter07/01-Background.html","title":"1.Background","keywords":"","body":"7.1 Background\n\n7.1.1 The Virtual Machine Paradigm\n  Before a high-level program can run on a target computer, it must be translated into the computer’s machine language. This translation—known as compilation—is a rather complex process. Normally, a separate compiler is written specifically for any given pair of high-level language and target machine language. This leads to a proliferation of many different compilers, each depending on every detail of both its source and destination languages. One way to decouple this dependency is to break the overall compilation process into two nearly separate stages. In the first stage, the high-level program is parsed and its commands are translated into intermediate processing steps—steps that are neither “high” nor “low.” In the second stage, the intermediate steps are translated further into the machine language of the target hardware.\n  This decomposition is very appealing from a software engineering perspective: The first stage depends only on the specifics of the source high-level language, and the second stage only on the specifics of the target machine language. Of course, the interface between the two compilation stages—the exact definition of the intermediate processing steps—must be carefully designed. In fact, this interface is sufficiently important to merit its own definition as a stand-alone language of an abstract machine. Specifically, one can formulate a virtual machine whose instructions are the intermediate processing steps into which high-level commands are decomposed. The compiler that was formerly a single monolithic program is now split into two separate programs. The first program, still termed compiler, translates the high-level code into intermediate VM instructions, while the second program translates this VM code into the machine language of the target platform.\n  This two-stage compilation model has been used—one way or another—in many compiler construction projects. Some developers went as far as defining a formal and stand-alone virtual machine language, most notably the p-code generated by several Pascal compilers in the 1970s. Java compilers are also two-tiered, generating a bytecode language that runs on the JVM virtual machine (also called the Java Runtime Environment). More recently, the approach has been adopted by the .NET infrastructure. In particular, .NET requires compilers to generate code written in an intermediate language (IL) that runs on a virtual machine called CLR (Common Language Runtime).\n  Indeed, the notion of an explicit and formal virtual machine language has several practical advantages. First, compilers for different target platforms can be obtained with relative ease by replacing only the virtual machine implementation (sometimes called the compiler’s backend). This, in turn, allows the VM code to become transportable across different hardware platforms, permitting a range of implementation trade-offs among code efficiency, hardware cost, and programming effort. Second, compilers for many languages can share the same VM backend, allowing code sharing and language interoperability. For example, one high-level language may be good at scientific calculations, while another may excel in handling the user interface. If both languages compile into a common VM layer, it is rather natural to have routines in one language call routines in the other, using an agreed-upon invocation syntax.\n  Another benefit of the virtual machine approach is modularity. Every improvement in the efficiency of the VM implementation is immediately inherited by all the compilers above it. Likewise, every new digital device or appliance that is equipped with a VM implementation can immediately benefit from a huge base of available software, as seen in figure 7.1.\n\n\n  Figure 7.1 The virtual machine paradigm. Once a high-level program is compiled into VM code, the program can run on any hardware platform equipped with a suitable VM implementation. In this chapter we start building the VM implementation on the Hack platform and use a VM emulator like the one depicted on the right.\n7.1.2 The Stack Machine Model\n  Like most programming languages, the VM language consists of arithmetic, memory access, program flow, and subroutine calling operations. There are several possible software paradigms on which to base such a language implementation. One of the key questions regarding this choice is where will the operands and the results of the VM operations reside? Perhaps the cleanest solution is to put them on a stack data structure.\n  In a stack machine model, arithmetic commands pop their operands from the top of the stack and push their results back onto the top of the stack. Other commands transfer data items from the stack’s top to designated memory locations, and vice versa. As it turns out, these simple stack operations can be used to implement the evaluation of any arithmetic or logical expression. Further, any program, written in any programming language, can be translated into an equivalent stack machine program. One such stack machine model is used in the Java Virtual Machine as well as in the VM described and built in what follows.\n  Elementary Stack Operations A stack is an abstract data structure that supports two basic operations: push and pop. The push operation adds an element to the top of the stack; the element that was previously on top is pushed below the newly added element. The pop operation retrieves and removes the top element; the element just below it moves up to the top position. Thus the stack implements a last-in-firstout (LIFO) storage model, illustrated in figure 7.2.\n\n\n  Figure 7.2 Stack processing example, illustrating the two elementary operations push and pop. Following convention, the stack is drawn upside down, as if it grows downward. The location just after the top position is always referred to by a special pointer called sp, or stack pointer. The labels a and b refer to two arbitrary memory addresses.\n  We see that stack access differs from conventional memory access in several respects. First, the stack is accessible only from the top, one item at a time. Second, reading the stack is a lossy operation: The only way to retrieve the top value is to remove it from the stack. In contrast, the act of reading a value from a regular memory location has no impact on the memory’s state. Finally, writing an item onto the stack adds it to the stack’s top, without changing the rest of the stack. In contrast, writing an item into a regular memory location is a lossy operation, since it overrides the location’s previous value.\n  The stack data structure can be implemented in several different ways. The simplest approach is to keep an array, say stack, and a stack pointer variable, say sp, that points to the available location just above the topmost element. The push x command is then implemented by storing x at the array entry pointed by sp and then incrementing sp (i.e., stack [sp]=x; sp=sp+1). The pop operation is implemented by first decrementing sp and then returning the value stored in the top position (i.e., sp=sp-1; return stack [sp]).\n  As usual in computer science, simplicity and elegance imply power of expression. The simple stack model is a versatile data structure that comes to play in many computer systems and algorithms. In the virtual machine architecture that we build here, it serves two key purposes. First, it is used for handling all the arithmetic and logical operations of the VM. Second, it facilitates subroutine calls and the associated memory allocation—the subjects of the next chapter.\n  Stack Arithmetic Stack-based arithmetic is a simple matter: the operands are popped from the stack, the required operation is performed on them, and the result is pushed back onto the stack. For example, here is how addition is handled:\n\n\n  The stack version of other operations (subtract, multiply, etc.) are precisely the same. For example, consider the expression d=(2-x)*(y+5), taken from some high-level program. The stack-based evaluation of this expression is shown in figure 7.3.\n  Stack-based evaluation of Boolean expressions has precisely the same flavor. For example, consider the high-level command if (x\n  The previous examples illustrate a general observation: any arithmetic and Boolean expression—no matter how complex—can be systematically converted into, and evaluated by, a sequence of simple operations on a stack. Thus, one can write a compiler that translates high-level arithmetic and Boolean expressions into sequences of stack commands, as we will do in chapters 10-11. We now turn to specify these commands (section 7.2), and describe their implementation on the Hack platform(section 7.3).\n"},"chapter07/02-VM_Specification_Part_I.html":{"url":"chapter07/02-VM_Specification_Part_I.html","title":"2.VM Specification, Part I","keywords":"","body":"7.2 VM Specification, Part I\n\n7.2.1 General\n  The virtual machine is stack-based: all operations are done on a stack. It is also function-based: a complete VM program is organized in program units called functions, written in the VM language. Each function has its own stand-alone code and is separately handled. The VM language has a single 16-bit data type that can be used as an integer, a Boolean, or a pointer. The language consists of four types of commands:\n    ■ Arithmetic commands perform arithmetic and logical operations on the stack\n    ■ Memory access commands transfer data between the stack and virtual memory segments.\n    ■ Program flow commands facilitate conditional and unconditional branching operations.\n    ■ Function calling commands call functions and return from them.\n\n\n  Figure 7.3 Stack-based evaluation of arithmetic expressions. This example evaluates the expression d = (2 - x) * (y + 5), assuming the initial memory state x = 5, y = 9.\n\n\n  Figure 7.4 Stack-based evaluation of logical expressions. This example evaluates the Boolean expression (x \n  Building a virtual machine is a complex undertaking, and so we divide it into two stages. In this chapter we specify the arithmetic and memory access commands and build a basic VM translator that implements them only. The next chapter specifies the program flow and function calling commands and extends the basic translator into a full-scale virtual machine implementation.\n  Program and Command Structure A VM program is a collection of one or more files with a .vm extension, each consisting of one or more functions. From a compilation standpoint, these constructs correspond, respectively, to the notions of program, class, and method in an object-oriented language.\n  Within a .vm file, each VM command appears in a separate line, and in one of the following formats: command (e.g., add), command arg (e.g., goto loop), or command arg1 arg2 (e.g., push local 3). The arguments are separated from each other and from the command part by an arbitrary number of spaces. “//” comments can appear at the end of any line and are ignored. Blank lines are permitted and ignored.\n7.2.2 Arithmetic and Logical Commands\n  The VM language features nine stack-oriented arithmetic and logical commands. Seven of these commands are binary: They pop two items off the stack, compute a binary function on them, and push the result back onto the stack. The remaining two commands are unary: they pop a single item off the stack, compute a unary function on it, and push the result back onto the stack. We see that each command has the net impact of replacing its operand(s) with the command’s result, without affecting the rest of the stack. Figure 7.5 gives the details.\n  Three of the commands listed in figure 7.5 (eq, gt, lt) return Boolean values. The VM represents true and false as -1 (minus one, 0xFFFF) and 0 (zero, 0x0000), respectively.\n7.2.3 Memory Access Command\n  So far in the chapter, memory access commands were illustrated using the pseudo-commands pop and push x, where the symbol x referred to an individual location in some global memory. Yet formally, our VM manipulates eight separate virtual memory segments, listed in figure 7.6.\n\n\n  Figure 7.5 Arithmetic and logical stack commands.\n  Memory Access Commands All the memory segments are accessed by the same two commands:\n\npush segment index Push the value of segment[index] onto the stack.\npop segment index Pop the top stack value and store it in segment[index].\n\n\n\n  Figure 7.6 The memory segments seen by every VM function.\n\n\n  Figure 7.7 The virtual memory segments are maintained by the VM implementation.\n  Where segment is one of the eight segment names and index is a non-negative integer. For example, push argument 2 followed by pop local 1 will store the value of the function’s third argument in the function’s second local variable (each segment’s index starts at 0).\n  The relationship among VM files, VM functions, and their respective virtual memory segments is depicted in figure 7.7.\n  In addition to the eight memory segments, which are managed explicitly by VM push and pop commands, the VM implementation manages two implicit data structures called stack and heap. These data structures are never mentioned directly, but their states change in the background, as a side effect of VM commands.\n  The Stack Consider the commands sequence push argument 2 and pop local 1, mentioned before. The working memory of such VM operations is the stack. The data value did not simply jump from one segment to another—it went through the stack. Yet in spite of its central role in the VM architecture, the stack proper is never mentioned in the VM language.\n  The Heap Another memory element that exists in the VM’s background is the heap. The heap is the name of the RAM area dedicated for storing objects and arrays data. These objects and arrays can be manipulated by VM commands, as we will see shortly.\n7.2.4 Program Flow and Function Calling Commands\n  The VM features six additional commands that are discussed at length in the next chapter. For completeness, these commands are listed here.\n\n\n  Program Flow Commands\n\n\n  Function Calling Commands\n  (In this list of commands, functionName is a symbol and nLocals and nArgs are non-negative integers.)\n7.2.5 Program Elements in the Jack-VM-Hack Platform\n  We end the first part of the VM specification with a top-down view of all the program elements that emerge from the full compilation of a typical high-level program. At the top of figure 7.8 we see a Jack program, consisting of two classes (Jack, a simple Java-like language, is described in chapter 9). Each Jack class consists of one or more methods. When the Jack compiler is applied to a directory that includes n class files, it produces n VM files (in the same directory). Each Jack method xxx within a class Yyy is translated into one VM function called Yyy.xxx within the corresponding VM file.\n\n\n  Figure 7.8 Program elements in the Jack-VM-Hack platform.\n  Next, the figure shows how the VM translator can be applied to the directory in which the VM files reside, generating a single assembly program. This assembly program does two main things. First, it emulates the virtual memory segments of each VM function and file, as well as the implicit stack. Second, it effects the VM commands on the target platform. This is done by manipulating the emulated VM data structures using machine language instructions—those translated from the VM commands. If all works well, that is, if the compiler and the VM translator and the assembler are implemented correctly, the target platform will end up effecting the behavior mandated by the original Jack program.\n7.2.6 VM Programming Examples\n  We end this section by illustrating how the VM abstraction can be used to express typical programming tasks found in high-level programs. We give three examples: (i) a typical arithmetic task, (ii) typical array handling, and (iii) typical object handling. These examples are irrelevant to the VM implementation, and in fact the entire section 7.2.6 can be skipped without losing the thread of the chapter.\n  The main purpose of this section is to illustrate how the compiler developed in chapters 10-11 will use the VM abstraction to translate high-level programs into VM code. Indeed, VM programs are rarely written by human programmers, but rather by compilers. Therefore, it is instructive to begin each example with a high-level code fragment, then show its equivalent representation using VM code. We use a C-style syntax for all the high-level examples.\n  A Typical Arithmetic Task Consider the multiplication algorithm shown at the top of figure 7.9. How should we (or more likely, the compiler) express this algorithm in the VM language? First, high-level structures like for and while must be rewritten using the VM’s simple “goto logic.” In a similar fashion, high-level arithmetic and Boolean operations must be expressed using stack-oriented commands. The resulting code is shown in figure 7.9. (The exact semantics of the VM commands function, label, goto, if- goto, and return are described in chapter 8, but their intuitive meaning is self-explanatory.)\n  Let us focus on the virtual segments depicted at the bottom of figure 7.9. We see that when a VM function starts running, it assumes that (i) the stack is empty, (ii) the argument values on which it is supposed to operate are located in the argument segment, and (iii) the local variables that it is supposed to use are initialized to 0 and located in the local segment.\n  Let us now focus on the VM representation of the algorithm. Recall that VM commands cannot use symbolic argument and variable names—they are limited to making 〈segment index〉 references only. However, the translation from the former to the latter is straightforward. All we have to do is map x, y, sum and j on argument 0, argument 1, local 0 and local 1, respectively, and replace all their symbolic occurrences in the pseudo code with corresponding 〈segment index〉 references.\n  To sum up, when a VM function starts running, it assumes that it is surrounded by a private world, all of its own, consisting of initialized argument and local segments and an empty stack, waiting to be manipulated by its commands. The agent responsible for staging this virtual worldview for every VM function just before it starts running is the VM implementation, as we will see in the next chapter.\n\n\n  Figure 7.9 VM programming example.\n\n\n  Array Handling An array is an indexed collection of objects. Suppose that a high-level program has created an array of ten integers called bar and filled it with some ten numbers. Let us assume that the array’s base has been mapped (behind the scene) on RAM address 4315. Suppose now that the high-level program wants to execute the command bar[2]=19. How can we implement this operation at the VM level?\n  In the C language, such an operation can be also specified as *(bar+2)=19, meaning “set the RAM\nlocation whose address is (bar+2) to 19.” As shown in figure 7.10, this operation lends itself perfectly well to the VM language.\n  It remains to be seen, of course, how a high-level command like bar [2]= 19 is translated in the first place into the VM code shown in figure 7.10. This transformation is described in section 11.1.1, when we discuss the code generation features of the compiler.\n  Object Handling High-level programmers view objects as entities that encapsulate data (organized as fields, or properties) and relevant code (organized as methods). Yet physically speaking, the data of each object instance is serialized on the RAM as a list of numbers representing the object’s field values. Thus the low-level handling of objects is quite similar to that of arrays.\n  For example, consider an animation program designed to juggle some balls on the screen. Suppose that each Ball object is characterized by the integer fields x, y, radius, and color. Let us assume that the program has created one such Ball object and called it b. What will be the internal representation of this object in the computer?\n  Like all other object instances, it will be stored in the RAM. In particular, whenever a program creates a new object, the compiler computes the object’s size in terms of words and the operating system finds and allocates enough RAM space to store it (the exact details of this operation are discussed in chapter 11). For now, let us assume that our b object has been allocated RAM addresses 3012 to 3015, as shown in figure 7.11.\n\n\n  Figure 7.10 VM-based array manipulation using the pointer and that segments.\n  Suppose now that a certain method in the high-level program, say resize, takes a Ball object and an integer r as arguments, and, among other things, sets the ball’s radius to r. The VM representation of this logic is shown in figure 7.11.\n\n\n  Figure 7.11 VM-based object manipulation using the pointer and this segments.\n  When we set pointer 0 to the value of argument 0, we are effectively setting the base of the virtual this segment to the object’s base address. From this point on, VM commands can access any field in the object using the virtual memory segment this and an index relative to the object’s base-address in memory.\n  But how did the compiler translate b.radius=17 into the VM code shown in figure 7.11? And how did the compiler know that the radius field of the object corresponds to the third field in its actual representation? We return to these questions in section 11.1.1, when we discuss the code generation features of the compiler.\n"},"chapter07/03-Implementation.html":{"url":"chapter07/03-Implementation.html","title":"3.Implementation","keywords":"","body":"7.3 Implementation\n\n  The virtual machine that was described up to this point is an abstract artifact. If we want to use it for real, we must implement it on a real platform. Building such a VM implementation consists of two conceptual tasks. First, we have to emulate the VM world on the target platform. In particular, each data structure mentioned in the VM specification, namely, the stack and the virtual memory segments, must be represented in some way by the target platform. Second, each VM command must be translated into a series of instructions that effect the command’s semantics on the target platform.\n  This section describes how to implement the VM specification (section 7.2) on the Hack platform. We start by defining a “standard mapping” from VM elements and operations to the Hack hardware and machine language. Next, we suggest guidelines for designing the software that achieves this mapping. In what follows, we will refer to this software using the terms VM implementation or VM translator interchangeably.\n7.3.1 Standard VM Mapping on the Hack Platform, Part I\n  If you reread the virtual machine specification given so far, you will realize that it contains no assumption whatsoever about the architecture on which the VM can be implemented. When it comes to virtual machines, this platform independence is the whole point: You don’t want to commit to any one hardware platform, since you want your machine to potentially run on all of them, including those that were not built yet.\n  It follows that the VM designer can principally let programmers implement the VM on target platforms in any way they see fit. However, it is usually recommended that some guidelines be provided as to how the VM should map on the target platform, rather than leaving these decisions completely to the implementer’s discretion. These guidelines, called standard mapping, are provided for two reasons. First, they entail a public contract that regulates how VM-based programs can interact with programs produced by compilers that don’t use this VM (e.g., compilers that produce binary code directly). Second, we wish to allow the developers of the VM implementation to run standardized tests, namely, tests that conform to the standard mapping. This way, the tests and the software can be written by different people, which is always recommended. With that in mind, the remainder of this section specifies the standard mapping of the VM on a familiar hardware platform: the Hack computer.\n  VM to Hack Translation Recall that a VM program is a collection of one or more .vm files, each containing one or more VM functions, each being a sequence of VM commands. The VM translator takes a collection of .vm files as input and produces a single Hack assembly language .asm file as output (see figure 7.7). Each VM command is translated by the VM translator into Hack assembly code. The order of the functions within the .vm files does not matter.\n  RAM Usage The data memory of the Hack computer consists of 32K 16-bit words. The first 16K serve as general-purpose RAM. The next 16K contain memory maps of I/O devices. The VM implementation should use this space as follows:\n\n\n  Recall that according to the Hack Machine Language Specification, RAM addresses 0 to 15 can be referred to by any assembly program using the symbols R0 to R15, respectively. In addition, the specification states that assembly programs can refer to RAM addresses 0 to 4 (i.e., R0 to R4) using the symbols SP, LCL, ARG, THIS, and THAT. This convention was introduced into the assembly language with foresight, in order to promote readable VM implementations. The expected use of these registers in the VM context is described as follows:\n\n\n  Memory Segments Mapping\n  local, argument, this, that: Each one of these segments is mapped directly on the RAM, and its location is maintained by keeping its physical base address in a dedicated register (LCL, ARG, THIS, and THAT, respectively). Thus any access to the ith entry of any one of these segments should be translated to assembly code that accesses address (base + i) in the RAM, where base is the current value stored in the register dedicated to the respective segment.\n  pointer, temp: These segments are each mapped directly onto a fixed area in the RAM. The pointer segment is mapped on RAM locations 3-4 (also called THIS and THAT) and the temp segment on locations 5-12 (also called R5, R6,..., R12). Thus access to pointer i should be translated to assembly code that accesses RAM location 3 + i, and access to temp i should be translated to assembly code that accesses RAM location 5 + i.\n  constant: This segment is truly virtual, as it does not occupy any physical space on the target architecture. Instead, the VM implementation handles any VM access to 〈constant i〉 by simply supplying the constant i.\n  static: According to the Hack machine language specification, when a new symbol is encountered for the first time in an assembly program, the assembler allocates a new RAM address to it, starting at address 16. This convention can be exploited to represent each static variable number j in a VM file f as the assembly language symbol f.j. For example, suppose that the file Xxx.vm contains the command push static 3. This command can be translated to the Hack assembly commands@Xxx.3 and D=M, followed by\nadditional assembly code that pushes D’s value to the stack. This implementation of the static segment is\nsomewhat tricky, but it works.\n  Assembly Language Symbols We recap all the assembly language symbols used by VM implementation that conform to the standard mapping.\n\n\n\n\n7.3.2 Design Suggestion for the VM Implementation\n  The VM translator should accept a single command line parameter, as follows:\nprompt> VMtranslator source\n  Where source is either a file name of the form Xxx.vm(the extension is mandatory) or a directory name containing one or more .vm files (in which case there is no extension). The result of the translation is always a single assembly language file named Xxx.asm, created in the same directory as the input Xxx. The translated code must conform to the standard VM mapping on the Hack platform.\n7.3.3 Program Structure\n  We propose implementing the VM translator using a main program and two modules: parser and code writer.\n  The Parser Module\n  Parser: Handles the parsing of a single .vm file, and encapsulates access to the input code. It reads VM commands, parses them, and provides convenient access to their components. In addition, it removes all white space and comments.\n\n\n\n\n  The Code Writer Module\n  CodeWriter: Translates VM commands into Hack assembly code.\n\n\n  Main Program The main program should construct a Parser to parse the VM input file and a CodeWriter to generate code into the corresponding output file. It should then march through the VM commands in the input file and generate assembly code for each one of them.\n  If the program’s argument is a directory name rather than a file name, the main program should process all the .vm files in this directory. In doing so, it should use a separate Parser for handling each input file and a single CodeWriter for handling the output.\n"},"chapter07/04-Perspective.html":{"url":"chapter07/04-Perspective.html","title":"4.Perspective","keywords":"","body":"7.4 Perspective\n\n  In this chapter we began the process of developing a compiler for a high-level language. Following modern software engineering practices, we have chosen to base the compiler on a two-tier compilation model. In the frontend tier, covered in chapters 10 and 11, the high-level code is translated into an intermediate code, running on a virtual machine. In the backend tier, covered in this and in the next chapter, the intermediate code is translated into the machine language of a target hardware platform (see figures 7.1 and 7.9).\n  The idea of formulating the intermediate code as the explicit language of a virtual machine goes back to the late 1970s, when it was used by several popular Pascal compilers. These compilers generated an intermediate “p-code” that could execute on any computer that implemented it. Following the wide spread use of the World Wide Web in the mid-1990s, cross-platform compatibility became a universally vexing issue. In order to address the problem, the Sun Microsystems company sought to develop a new programming language that could potentially run on any computer and digital device connected to the Internet. The language that emerged from this initiative—Java—is also founded on an intermediate code execution model called the Java Virtual Machine, on JVM.\n  The JVM is a specification that describes an intermediate language called byte-code—the target language of Java compilers. Files written in bytecode are then used for dynamic code distribution of Java programs over the Internet, most notably as applets embedded in web pages. Of course in order to execute these programs, the client computers must be equipped with suitable JVM implementations. These programs, also called Java Run-time Environments (JREs), are widely available for numerous processor/OS combinations, including game consoles and cell phones.\n  In the early 2000s, Microsoft entered the fray with its .NET infrastructure. The centerpiece of .NET is a virtual machine model called Common Language Runtime (CLR). According to the Microsoft vision, many programming languages (including C++, C#, Visual Basic, and J#—a Java variant) could be compiled into intermediate code running on the CLR. This enables code written in different languages to interoperate and share the software libraries of a common run-time environment.\n  We note in closing that a crucial ingredient that must be added to the virtual machine model before its full potential of interoperability is unleashed is a common software library. Indeed the Java virtual machine comes with the standard Java libraries, and the Microsoft virtual machine comes with the Common Language Runtime. These software libraries can be viewed as small operating systems, providing the languages that run on top of the VM with unified services like memory management, GUI utilities, string functions, math functions, and so on. One such library will be described and built in chapter 12.\n"},"chapter07/05-Project.html":{"url":"chapter07/05-Project.html","title":"5.Project","keywords":"","body":"7.5 Project\n\n  This section describes how to build the VM translator presented in the chapter. In the next chapter we will extend this basic translator with additional functionality, leading to a full-scale VM implementation. Before you get started, two comments are in order. First, section 7.2.6 is irrelevant to this project. Second, since the VM translator is designed to generate Hack assembly code, it is recommended to refresh your memory about the Hack assembly language rules (section 4.2).\n  Objective Build the first part of the VM translator (the second part is implemented in Project 8), focusing on the implementation of the stack arithmetic and memory access commands of the VM language.\n  Resources You will need two tools: the programming language in which you will implement your VM translator, and the CPU emulator supplied with the book. This emulator will allow you to execute the machine code generated by your VM translator—an indirect way to test the correctness of the latter. Another tool that may come in handy in this project is the visual VM emulator supplied with the book. This program allows experimenting with a working VM implementation before you set out to build one yourself. For more information about this tool, refer to the VM emulator tutorial.\n  Contract Write a VM-to-Hack translator, conforming to the VM Specification, Part I (section 7.2) and to the Standard VM Mapping on the Hack Platform, Part I (section 7.3.1). Use it to translate the test VM programs supplied here, yielding corresponding programs written in the Hack assembly language. When executed on the supplied CPU emulator, the assembly programs generated by your translator should deliver the results mandated by the supplied test scripts and compare files.\n  Proposed Implementation Stages\n  We recommend building the translator in two stages. This will allow you to unit-test your implementation incrementally, using the test programs supplied here.\n  Stage I: Stack Arithmetic Commands The first version of your VM translator should implement the nine stack arithmetic and logical commands of the VM language as well as the push constant x command (which, among other things, will help in testing the nine former commands). Note that the latter is the generic push command for the special case where the first argument is constant and the second argument is some decimal constant.\n  Stage II: Memory Access Commands The next version of your translator should include a full implementation of the VM language’s push and pop commands, handling all eight memory segments. We suggest breaking this stage into the following substages:\n\nYou have already handled the constant segment.\nNext, handle the segments local, argument, this, and that.\nNext, handle the pointer and temp segments, in particular allowing modification of the bases of the this and that segments.\nFinally, handle the static segment\n\n  Test Programs\n  The five VM programs listed here are designed to unit-test the proposed implementation stages just described.\n  Stage I: Stack Arithmetic\n    ■ SimpleAdd: Pushes and adds two constants\n    ■ StackTest: Executes a sequence of arithmetic and logical operations on the stack.\n  Stage II: Memory Access\n    ■ BasicTest: Executes pop and push operations using the virtual memory segments.\n    ■ PointerTest: Executes pop and push operations using the pointer, this, and that segments.\n    ■ StaticTest: Executes pop and push operations using the static segment.\n    For each program Xxx we supply four files, beginning with the program’s code in Xxx.vm. The XxxVME.tst script allows running the program on the supplied VM emulator, so that you can gain familiarity with the program’s intended operation. After translating the program using your VM translator, the supplied Xxx.tst and Xxx.cmp scripts allow testing the translated assembly code on the CPU emulator\n  Tips\n  Initialization In order for any translated VM program to start running, it must include a preamble startup code that forces the VM implementation to start executing it on the host platform. In addition, in order for any VM code to operate properly, the VM implementation must anchor the base addresses of the virtual segments in selected RAM locations. Both issues—startup code and segments initializations—are implemented in the next project. The difficulty of course is that we need these initializations in place in order to execute the test programs given in this project. The good news is that you should not worry about these issues at all, since the supplied test scripts carry out all the necessary initializations in a manual fashion (for the purpose of this project only).\n  Testing/Debugging For each one of the five test programs, follow these steps:\n\nRun the Xxx.vm program on the supplied VM emulator, using the XxxVME.tst test script, to get acquainted with the intended program’s behavior.\nUse your partial translator to translate the .vm file. The result should be a text file containing a translated .asm program, written in the Hack assembly language.\nInspect the translated .asm program. If there are visible syntax (or any other) errors, debug and fix you translator.\nUse the supplied .tst and .cmp files to run your translated .asm program on the CPU emulator. If there are run-time errors, debug and fix your translator.\n\n  The supplied test programs were carefully planned to test the specific features of each stage in your VM implementation. Therefore, it’s important to implement your translator in the proposed order and to test it using the appropriate test programs at each stage. Implementing a later stage before an early one may cause the test programs to fail.\n\n\n  Figure 7.12 The VM emulator supplied with the book.\n  Tools\n  The VM Emulator The book’s software suite includes a Java-based VM implementation. This VM emulator allows executing VM programs directly, without having to translate them first into machine language. This practice enables experimentation with the VM environment before you set out to implement one yourself. Figure 7.12 is a typical screen shot of the VM emulator in action.\n"},"chapter08/00-Virtual_Machine_II_Program_Control.html":{"url":"chapter08/00-Virtual_Machine_II_Program_Control.html","title":"08. Virtual Machine II: Program Control","keywords":"","body":"Chapter 8: Virtual Machine II: Program Control\n\n\n\n  If everything seems under control, you’re just not going fast enough\n——Mario Andretti (b. 1940), race car champion\n\n\n  Chapter 7 introduced the notion of a virtual machine (VM) and ended with the construction of a basic VM implementation over the Hack platform. In this chapter we continue to develop the VM abstraction, language, and implementation. In particular, we design stack-based mechanisms for handling nested subroutine calls (procedures, functions, methods) of procedural or object-oriented languages. As the chapter progresses, we extend the previously built basic VM implementation, ending with a full-scale VM translator. This translator will serve as the backend of the compiler that we will build in chapters 10 and 11, following the introduction of a high-level object-based language in chapter 9.\n  In any Great Gems in Computer Science contest, stack processing will be a strong finalist. The previous chapter showed how arithmetic and Boolean expressions can be calculated by elementary stack operations. This chapter goes on to show how this remarkably simple data structure can also support remarkably complex tasks like nested subroutine calling, parameter passing, recursion, and the associated memory allocation techniques. Most programmers tend to take these capabilities for granted, expecting the compiler to deliver them, one way or another. We are now in a position to open this black box and see how these fundamental programming mechanisms are actually implemented by a stack-based virtual machine.\n"},"chapter08/01-Background.html":{"url":"chapter08/01-Background.html","title":"1.Background","keywords":"","body":"8.1 Background\n\n  High-level languages allow writing programs in high-level terms. For example,  can be expressed as x=-b+sqrt(power(b,2)-4*a*c), which is almost as descriptive as the real thing. High-level languages support this power of expression through three conventions. First, one is allowed to freely define high-level operations like sqrt and power, as needed. Second, one is allowed to freely use (call) these subroutines as if they were elementary operations like + and *. Third, one is allowed to assume that each called subroutine will get executed—somehow—and that following its termination control will return—somehow—to the next command in one’s code. Flow of control commands take this freedom one step further, allowing writing, say, if ~(a=0) {x=(-b+sqrt(power(b,2)-4*a*c))/ (2*a)} else {x=-c/b}.\n  The ability to compose such expressions freely permits us to write abstract code, closer to the world of algorithmic thought than to that of machine execution. Of course the more abstract the high level, the more work we have to do at the low level. In particular, the low level must manage the delicate interplay between the calling subroutine (the caller) and the called subroutines—the program units that implement system- and user-defined operations like sqrt and power. For each subroutine call during runtime, the low level must handle the following details behind the scene:\n    • Passing parameters fromthe caller to the called subroutine\n    • Saving the state of the caller before switching to execute the called subroutine\n    • Allocating space for the local variables of the called subroutine\n    • Jumping to execute the called subroutine\n    • Returning values fromthe called subroutine back to the caller\n    • Recycling the memory space occupied by the called subroutine, when it returns\n    • Reinstating the state of the caller\n    • Jumping to execute the code of the caller immediately following the spot where we left it\n  Taking care of these housekeeping chores is a major headache, and high-level programmers are fortunate that the compiler relieves them from this duty. So how does the compiler do it? Well, if we choose to base our low level implementation on a stack machine, the job will be surprisingly manageable. In fact, the stack structure lends itself perfectly well to supporting all the housekeeping tasks mentioned above.\n  With that in mind, the remainder of this section describes how program flow and subroutine calling commands can be implemented on a stack machine. We begin with the implementation of program flow commands, which is rather simple and requires no memory management, and continue to describe the more challenging implementation of subroutine calling commands.\n8.1.1 Program Flow\n  The default execution of computer programs is linear, one command after the other. This sequential flow is occasionally broken by branching commands, for example, embarking on a new iteration in a loop. In low-level programming, the branching logic is accomplished by instructing the machine to continue execution at some destination in the program other than the next instruction, using a goto destination command. The destination specification can take several forms, the most primitive being the physical address of the instruction that should be executed next. A slightly more abstract redirection command is established by describing the jump destination using a symbolic label. This variation requires that the language be equipped with some labeling directive, designed to assign symbols to selected points in the code.\n  This basic goto mechanism can easily be altered to effect conditional branching as well. For example, an if-goto destination command can instruct the machine to take the jump only if a given Boolean condition is true; if the condition is false, the regular program flow should continue, executing the next command in the code. How should we introduce the Boolean condition into the language? In a stack machine paradigm, the most natural approach is conditioning the jump on the value of the stack’s topmost element: if it’s not zero, jump to the specified destination; otherwise, execute the next command in the program.\n  In chapter 7 we saw how primitive VM operations can be used to compute any Boolean expression, leaving its truth-value at the stack’s topmost element. This power of expression, combined with the goto and if-goto commands just described, can be used to express any flow of control structure found in any programming language. Two typical examples appear in figure 8.1.\n  The low-level implementation of the VM commands label, goto label, and if-goto label is straightforward. All programming languages, including the “lowest” ones, feature branching commands of some sort. For example, if our low-level implementation is based on translating the VM commands into assembly code, all we have to do is reexpress these goto commands using the branching logic of the assembly language.\n8.1.2 Subroutine Calling\n  Each programming language is characterized by a fixed set of built-in commands. The key abstraction mechanism provided by modern languages is the freedom to extend this basic repertoire with high-level, programmer-defined operations. In procedural languages, the high-level operations are called subroutines, procedures, or functions, and in object-oriented languages they are usually called methods. Throughout this chapter, all these high-level programunits are referred to as subroutines.\n\n\n  Figure 8.1 Low-level flow of control using goto commands.\n  In well-designed programming languages, the use of a high-level operation (implemented by a subroutine) has the same “look and feel” as that of built-in commands. For example, consider the functions add and raise to a power. Most languages feature the former as a built-in operation, while the latter may be written as a subroutine. In spite of these different implementations, both functions should ideally look alike from the caller’s perspective. This would allow the caller to weave the two operations together naturally, yielding consistent and readable code. A stack language implementation of this principle is illustrated in figure 8.2.\n  We see that the only difference between invoking a built-in command and calling a user-defined subroutine is the keyword call preceding the latter. Everything else is exactly the same: Both operations require the caller to set up their arguments, both operations are expected to remove their arguments from the stack, and both operations are expected to return a value which becomes the topmost stack element. The uniformity of this protocol has a subtle elegance that, we hope, is not lost on the reader.\n\n\n  Figure 8.2 Subroutine calling. Elementary commands (like add) and high-level operations (like power) have the same look and feel in terms of argument handling and return values.\n  Subroutines like power usually use local variables for temporary storage. These local variables must be represented in memory during the subroutine’s lifetime, namely, from the point the subroutine starts executing until a return command is encountered. At this point, the memory space occupied by the subroutine’s local variables can be freed. This scheme is complicated by allowing subroutines to be arbitrarily nested: One subroutine may call another subroutine, which may then call another one, and so on. Further, subroutines should be allowed to call themselves recursively; each recursive call must be executed independently of all the other calls and maintain its own set of local and argument variables. How can we implement this nesting mechanismand the memory management tasks implied by it?\n  The property that makes this housekeeping task tractable is the hierarchical nature of the call-and-return logic. Although the subroutine calling chain may be arbitrarily deep as well as recursive, at any given point in time only one subroutine executes at the top of the chain, while all the other subroutines down the calling chain are waiting for it to terminate. This Last-In-First-Out (LIFO) processing model lends itself perfectly well to a stack data structure, which is also LIFO. When subroutine xxx calls subroutine yyy, we can push (save) xxx’s world on the stack and branch to execute yyy. When yyy returns, we can pop (reinstate) xxx’s world off the stack, and continue executing xxx as if nothing happened. This execution model is illustrated in figure 8.3.\n  We use the term frame to refer, conceptually, to the subroutine’s local variables, the arguments on which it operates, its working stack, and the other memory segments that support its operation. In chapter 7, the term stack referred to the working memory that supports operations like pop, push, add, and so on. From now on, when we say stack we mean global stack—-the memory area containing the frames of the current subroutine and all the subroutines waiting for it to return. These two stack notions are closely related, since the working stack of the current subroutine is located at the very tip of the global stack.\n\n\n  Figure 8.3 Subroutine calls and stack states associated with three representative points in the program’s life cycle. All the layers in the stack are waiting for the current layer to complete its execution, at which point the stack becomes shorter and execution resumes at the level just below the current layer. (Following convention, the stack is drawn as if it grows downward.)\n  To recap, the low-level implementation of the call xxx operation entails saving the caller’s frame on the stack, allocating stack space for the local variables of the called subroutine (xxx), then jumping to execute its code. This last “mega jump” is not hard to implement. Since the name of the target subroutine is specified in the call command, the implementation can resolve the symbolic name to a memory address, then jump to execute the code starting at that address. Returning from the called subroutine via a return command is trickier, since the command specifies no return address. Indeed, the caller’s anonymity is inherent in the very notion of a subroutine call. For example, subroutines like power(x,y) or sqrt(x) are designed to serve any caller, implying that the return address cannot be part of their code. Instead, a return command should be interpreted as follows: Redirect the program’s execution to the command following the call command that called the current subroutine, wherever this command may be. The memory location of this command is called return address.\n  A glance at figure 8.3 suggests a stack-based solution to implementing this return logic. When we encounter a call xxx operation, we know exactly what the return address should be: It’s the address of the next command in the caller’s code. Thus, we can push this return address on the stack and proceed to execute the code of the called subroutine. When we later encounter a return command, we can pop the saved return address and simply goto it. In other words, the return address can also be placed in the caller’s frame.\n"},"chapter08/02-VM_Specification_Part_II.html":{"url":"chapter08/02-VM_Specification_Part_II.html","title":"2.VM Specification, Part II","keywords":"","body":"8.2 VM Specification, Part II\n\n  This section extends the basic VM specification from chapter 7 with program flow and function calling commands, thereby completing the overall VM specification.\n8.2.1 Program Flow Commands\n  The VM language features three programflow commands:\n    ■ label label This command labels the current location in the function’s code.\n    Only labeled locations can be jumped to from other parts of the program. The scope of the label is the function in which it is defined. The label is an arbitrary string composed of any sequence of letters, digits, underscore (_), dot (.), and colon (:) that does not begin with a digit.\n    ■ goto label This command effects an unconditional goto operation, causing execution to continue from the location marked by the label. The jump destination must be located in the same function.\n    ■ if-goto label This command effects a conditional goto operation. The stack’s topmost value is popped; if the value is not zero, execution continues from the location marked by the label; otherwise, execution continues from the next command in the program. The jump destination must be located in the same function.\n8.2.2 Function Calling Commands\n  Different high-level languages have different names for program units including functions, procedures, methods, and subroutines. In our overall compilation model (elaborated in chapters 10-11), each such high-level program unit is translated into a low-level program unit called VM function, or simply function.\n  A function has a symbolic name that is used globally to call it. The function name is an arbitrary string composed of any sequence of letters, digits, underscore (_), dot (.), and colon (:) that does not begin with a digit. (We expect that a method bar in class Foo in some high-level language will be translated by the compiler to a VM function named Foo.bar). The scope of the function name is global: All functions in all files are seen by each other and may call each other using the function name.\n  The VM language features three function-related commands:\n    ■ function f n Here starts the code of a function named f that has n local variables;\n    ■ call f m Call function f, stating that m arguments have already been pushed onto the stack by the caller;\n    ■ return Return to the calling function.\n8.2.3 The Function Calling Protocol\n  The events of calling a function and returning from a function can be viewed from two different perspectives: that of the calling function and that of the called function.\n  The calling function view:\n  ■ Before calling the function, the caller must push as many arguments as necessary onto the stack;\n  ■ Next, the caller invokes the function using the call command;\n  ■ After the called function returns, the arguments that the caller has pushed before the call have disappeared fromthe stack, and a return value (that always exists) appears at the top of the stack;\n  ■ After the called function returns, the caller’s memory segments argument, local, static, this, that, and pointer are the same as before the call, and the temp segment is undefined.\n  The called function view:\n  ■ When the called function starts executing, its argument segment has been initialized with actual argument values passed by the caller and its local variables segment has been allocated and initialized to zeros. The static segment that the called function sees has been set to the static segment of the VM file to which it belongs, and the working stack that it sees is empty. The segments this, that, pointer, and temp are undefined upon entry.\n  ■ Before returning, the called function must push a value onto the stack.\n  To repeat an observation made in the previous chapter, we see that when a VM function starts running (or resumes its previous execution), it assumes that it is surrounded by a private world, all of its own, consisting of its memory segments and stack, waiting to be manipulated by its commands. The agent responsible for building this virtual worldview for every VM function is the VM implementation, as we elaborate in section 8.3.\n8.2.4 Initialization\n  A VM program is a collection of related VM functions, typically resulting from the compilation of some high-level program. When the VM implementation starts running (or is reset), the convention is that it always executes an argument-less VM function called Sys.init. Typically, this function then calls the main function in the user’s program. Thus, compilers that generate VM code must ensure that each translated program will have one such Sys.init function.\n"},"chapter08/03-Implementation.html":{"url":"chapter08/03-Implementation.html","title":"3.Implementation","keywords":"","body":"8.3 Implementation\n\n  This section describes how to complete the VM implementation that we started building in chapter 7, leading to a full-scale virtual machine implementation. Section 8.3.1 describes the stack structure that must be maintained, along with its standard mapping over the Hack platform. Section 8.3.2 gives an example, and section 8.3.3 provides design suggestions and a proposed API for actually building the VM implementation.\n  Some of the implementation details are rather technical, and dwelling on them may distract attention from the overall VM operation. This big picture is restored in section 8.3.2, which illustrates the VM implementation in action. Therefore, one may want to consult 8.3.2 for motivation while reading 8.3.1.\n8.3.1 Standard VM Mapping on the Hack Platform, Part II\n  The Global Stack The memory resources of the VM are implemented by maintaining a global stack. Each time a function is called, a new block is added to the global stack. The block consists of the arguments that were set for the called function, a set of pointers used to save the state of the calling function, the local variables of the called function (initialized to 0), and an empty working stack for the called function. Figure 8.4 shows this generic stack structure.\n\n\n  Figure 8.4 The global stack structure.\n  Note that the shaded areas in figure 8.4 as well as the ARG, LCL, and SP pointers are never seen by VM functions. Rather, they are used by the VM implementation to implement the function call-and-return protocol behind the scene.\n  How can we implement this model on the Hack platform? Recall that the standard mapping specifies that the stack should start at RAM address 256, meaning that the VM implementation can start by generating assembly code that sets SP=256. From this point onward, when the VM implementation encounters commands like pop, push, add, and so forth, it can emit assembly code that effects these operations by manipulating SP and relevant words in the host RAM. All this was already done in chapter 7. Likewise, when the VM implementation encounters commands like call, function, and return, it can emit assembly code that maintains the stack structure shown in figure 8.4 on the host RAM. This code is described next.\n  Function Calling Protocol Implementation The function calling protocol and the global stack structure implied by it can be implemented on the Hack platform by effecting (in Hack assembly) the pseudo-code given in figure 8.5.\n  Recall that the VM implementation is a translator program, written in some high-level language. It accepts VM code as input and emits assembly code as output. Hence, each pseudo-operation described in the right column of figure 8.5 is actually implemented by emitting assembly language instructions. Note that some of these “instructions” entail planting label declarations in the generated code stream.\n\n\n  Figure 8.5 VM implementation of function commands. The parenthetical (return address) and (f ) are label declarations, using Hack assembly syntax convention.\n  Assembly Language Symbols As we have seen earlier, the implementation of program flow and function calling commands requires the VM implementation to create and use special symbols at the assembly level. These symbols are summarized in figure 8.6. For completeness of presentation, the first three rows of the table document the symbols described and implemented in chapter 7.\n\n\n  Figure 8.6 All the special assembly symbols prescribed by the VM-on-Hack standard mapping.\n  Bootstrap Code When applied to a VM program (a collection of one or more .vm files), the VM-to-Hack translator produces a single .asm file, written in the Hack assembly language. This file must conform to certain conventions. Specifically, the standard mapping specifies that (i) the VM stack should be mapped on location RAM[256] onward, and (ii) the first VM function that starts executing should be Sys.init (see section 8.2.4).\n  How can we effect this initialization in the .asm file produced by the VM translator? Well, when we built the Hack computer hardware in chapter 5, we wired it in such a way that upon reset, it will fetch and execute the word located in ROM[0]. Thus, the code segment that starts at ROM address 0, called bootstrap code, is the first thing that gets executed when the computer “boots up.” Therefore, in view of the previous paragraph, the computer’s bootstrap code should effect the following operations (in machine language):\n\n\n  Sys.init is then expected to call the main function of the main program and then enter an infinite loop. This action should cause the translated VM programto start running.\n  The notions of “program,” “main program,” and “main function” are compilation-specific and vary from one high-level language to another. For example, in the Jack language, the default is that the first program unit that starts running automatically is the main method of a class named Main. In a similar fashion, when we tell the JVM to execute a given Java class, say Foo, it looks for, and executes, the Foo.main method. Each language compiler can effect such “automatic” startup routines by programming Sys.init appropriately.\n8.3.2 Example\n  The factorial of a positive number n can be computed by the iterative formula n! = 1 ·2·... ·(n - 1) · n. This algorithmis implemented in figure 8.7.\n  Let us focus on the call mult command highlighted in the fact function code from figure 8.7. Figure 8.8shows three stack states related to this call, illustrating the function calling protocol in action.\n  If we ignore the middle stack instance in figure 8.8, we observe that fact has set up some arguments and called mult to operate on them(left stack instance). When mult returns (right stack instance), the arguments of the called function have been replaced with the function’s return value. In other words, when the dust clears from the function call, the calling function has received the service that it has requested, and processing resumes as if nothing happened: The drama of mult’s processing (middle stack instance) has left no trace whatsoever on the stack, except for the return value.\n\n\n  Figure 8.7 The life cycle of function calls. An arbitrary function p calls function fact, which then calls mult several times. Vertical arrows depict transfer of control from one function to another. At any given point in time, only one function is running, while all the functions up the calling chain are waiting for it to return. When a function returns, the function that called it resumes its execution.\n\n\n  Figure 8.8 Global stack dynamics corresponding to figure 8.7, focusing on the call mult event. The pointers SP, ARG, and LCL are not part of the VM abstraction and are used by the VM implementation to map the stack on the host RAM.\n8.3.3 Design Suggestions for the VM Implementation\n  The basic VM translator built in Project 7 was based on two modules: parser and code writer. This translator can be extended into a full-scale VM implementation by extending these modules with the functionality described here.\n  The Parser Module If the basic parser that you built in Project 7 does not already parse the six VM commands specified in this chapter, then add their parsing now. Specifically, make sure that the commandType method developed in Project 7 also returns the constants corresponding to the six VM commands described in this chapter: C_LABEL, C_GOTO, C_IF, C_FUNCTION, C_RETURN, and C_CALL.\n  The CodeWriter Module The basic CodeWriter specified in chapter 7 should be augmented with the following methods.\n  CodeWriter: Translates VM commands into Hack assembly code. The routines listed here should be added to the CodeWriter module API given in chapter 7.\n\n\n\n"},"chapter08/04-Perspective.html":{"url":"chapter08/04-Perspective.html","title":"4.Perspective","keywords":"","body":"8.4 Perspective\n\n  The notions of subroutine calling and program flow are fundamental to all high-level languages. This means that somewhere down the translation path to binary code, someone must take care of the intricate housekeeping chores related to their implementation. In Java, C#, and Jack, this burden falls on the VM level. And if the VM is stack-based, it lends itself nicely to the job, as we have seen throughout this chapter. In general then, virtual machines that implement subroutine calls and recursion as a primitive feature deliver a significant and useful abstraction.\n  Of course this is just one implementation option. Some compilers handle the details of subroutine calling directly, without using a VM at all. Other compilers use various forms of VMs, but not necessarily for managing subroutine calling. Finally, in some architectures most of the subroutine calling functionality is handled directly by the hardware.\n  In the next two chapters we will develop a Jack-to-VM compiler. Since the back-end of this compiler was already developed—it is the VM implementation built in chapters 7-8—the compiler’s development will be a relatively easy task.\n"},"chapter08/05-Project.html":{"url":"chapter08/05-Project.html","title":"5.Project","keywords":"","body":"8.5 Project\n\n  Objective Extend the basic VM translator built in Project 7 into a full-scale VM translator. In particular, add the ability to handle the programflow and function calling commands of the VM language.\n  Resources (same as Project 7) You will need two tools: the programming language in which you will implement your VM translator, and the CPU emulator supplied with the book. This emulator will allow you to execute the machine code generated by your VM translator—an indirect way to test the correctness of the latter. Another tool that may come in handy in this project is the visual VM emulator supplied with the book. This program allows experimenting with a working VM implementation before you set out to build one yourself. For more information about this tool, refer to the VM emulator tutorial.\n  Contract Write a full-scale VM-to-Hack translator, extending the translator developed in Project 7, and conforming to the VM Specification, Part II (section 8.2) and to the Standard VM Mapping on the Hack Platform (section 8.3.1). Use it to translate the VM programs supplied below, yielding corresponding programs written in the Hack assembly language. When executed on the supplied CPU emulator, these assembly programs should deliver the results mandated by the supplied test scripts and compare files.\n  Testing Programs\n  We recommend completing the implementation of the translator in two stages. First implement the program flow commands, then the function calling commands. This will allow you to unit-test your implementation incrementally, using the test programs supplied here.\n  For each program Xxx, the XxxVME.tst script allows running the program on the supplied VM emulator, so that you can gain familiarity with the program’s intended operation. After translating the program using your VM translator, the supplied Xxx.tst and Xxx.cmp scripts allow testing the translated assembly code on the CPU emulator.\n  Test Programs for Program Flow Commands\n    ■ BasicLoop: computes 1 + 2 + ··· + n and pushes the result onto the stack. This program tests the implementation of the VM language’s goto and if-goto commands.\n    ■ Fibonacci: computes and stores in memory the first n elements of the Fibonacci series. This typical array manipulation programprovides a more challenging test of the VM’s branching commands.\n  Test Programs for Function Calling Commands\n    ■ SimpleFunction: performs a simple calculation and returns the result. This program provides a basic test of the implementation of the function and return commands.\n    ■ FibonacciElement: This program provides a full test of the implementation of the VM’s function calling commands, the bootstrap section, and most of the other VM commands.\n    The programdirectory consists of two .vm files:\n    ● Main.vm contains one function called fibonacci. This recursive function returns the n-th element of the Fibonacci series;\n    ● Sys.vm contains one function called init. This function calls the Main.fibonacci function with n = 4, then loops infinitely.\n    Since the overall program consists of two .vm files, the entire directory must be compiled in order to produce a single FibonacciElement.asm file. (compiling each ● vm file separately will yield two separate .asm files, which is not desired here).\n    ■ StaticsTest: A full test of the VM implementation’s handling of static variables. Consists of two .vm files, each representing the compilation of a stand-alone class file, plus a Sys.vm file. The entire directory should be compiled in order to produce a single StaticsTest.asm file.\n    (Recall that according to the VM Specification, the bootstrap code generated by the VM implementation must include a call to the Sys.init function).\n  Tips\n  Initialization In order for any translated VM program to start running, it must include a preamble startup code that forces the VM implementation to start executing it on the host platform. In addition, in order for any VM code to operate properly, the VM implementation must store the base addresses of the virtual segments in selected locations in the host RAM. The first three test programs in this project assume that the startup code was not yet implemented and include test scripts that effect the necessary initializations “manually.” The last two programs assume that the startup code is already part of the VM implementation.\n  Testing/Debugging For each one of the five test programs, follow these steps:\n\nRun the program on the supplied VM emulator, using the XxxVME.tst test script, to get acquainted with the intended program’s behavior.\nUse your partial translator to translate the .vm file(s), yielding a single .asm text file that contains a translated programwritten in the Hack assembly language.\nInspect the translated .asm program. If there are visible syntax (or any other) errors, debug and fix your translator.\nUse the supplied .tst and .cmp files to run your translated .asm program on the CPU emulator. If there are run-time errors, debug and fix your translator.\n\n  Note: The supplied test programs were carefully planned to unit-test the specific features of each stage in your VM implementation. Therefore, it’s important to implement your translator in the proposed order and to test it using the appropriate test programs at each stage. Implementing a later stage before an early one may cause the test programs to fail.\n  Tools Same as in Project 7.\n"},"chapter09/00-High-Level_Language.html":{"url":"chapter09/00-High-Level_Language.html","title":"09. High-Level Language","keywords":"","body":"Chapter 9: High-Level Language\n\n\n\n  High thoughts need a high language.\n——Aristophanes (448-380 BC)\n\n\n  All the hardware and software systems presented so far in the book were low-level, meaning that humans are not expected to interact with them directly. In this chapter we present a high-level language, called Jack, designed to enable human programmers write high-level programs. Jack is a simple object-based language. It has the basic features and flavor of modern languages like Java and C#, with a much simpler syntax and no support for inheritance. In spite of this simplicity, Jack is a general-purpose language that can be used to create numerous applications. In particular, it lends itself nicely to simple interactive games like Snake, Tetris, and Pong—a program whose complete Jack code is included in the book’s software suite.\n  The introduction of Jack marks the beginning of the end of our journey. In chapters 10 and 11 we will write a compiler that translates Jack programs into VM code, and in chapter 12 we will develop a simple operating system for the Jack/Hack platform, written in Jack. This will complete the computer’s construction. With that in mind, it’s important to say at the outset that the goal of this chapter is not to turn you into a Jack programmer. Instead, our hidden agenda is to prepare you to develop the compiler and operating system that lie ahead.\n  If you have any experience with a modern object-oriented programming language, you will immediately feel at home with Jack. Therefore, the Background section starts the chapter with some typical programming examples, and the Specification section proceeds with a full functional description of the language and its standard library. The Implementation section gives some screen shots of typical Jack applications and offers general guidelines on how to write similar programs over the Hack platform. The final Project section provides additional details about compiling and debugging Jack programs.\n  All the programs shown in the chapter can be compiled by the Jack compiler supplied with the book. The resulting VM code can then run as is on the supplied VM emulator. Alternatively, one can further translate the compiled VM code into binary code, using the VM translator and the assembler built in chapters 7-8 and 6, respectively. The resulting machine code can then be executed as is on the hardware platform that we built in chapters 1-5.\n  It’s important to reiterate that in and by itself, Jack is a rather uninteresting and simple-minded language. However, this simplicity has a purpose. First, you can learn (and unlearn) Jack very quickly— in about an hour. Second, the Jack language was carefully planned to lend itself nicely to simple compilation techniques. As a result, one can write an elegant Jack compiler with relative ease, as we will do in chapters 10 and 11. In other words, the deliberately simple structure of Jack is designed to help uncover the software engineering principles underlying modern languages like Java and C#. Rather than taking the compilers and run-time environments of these languages for granted, we will build a Jack compiler and a run-time environment ourselves, beginning in the next chapter. For now, let’s take Jack out of the box.\n"},"chapter09/01-Background.html":{"url":"chapter09/01-Background.html","title":"1.Background","keywords":"","body":"9.1 Background\n\n  Jack is mostly self-explanatory. Therefore, we defer the language specification to the next section, starting with some examples. We begin with the inevitable Hello World program. The second example illustrates procedural programming and array processing. The third example illustrates how the basic language can be extended with abstract data types. The fourth example illustrates a linked list implementation using the language’s object handling capabilities.\n9.1.1 Example 1: Hello World\n  When we tell the Jack run-time environment to run a given program, execution always starts with the Main.main function. Thus, each Jack program must include at least one class named Main, and this class must include at least one function named Main.main. This convention is illustrated in figure 9.1.\n  Jack is equipped with a standard library whose complete API is given in section 9.2.7. This library extends the basic language with various abstractions and services such as arrays, strings, mathematical functions, memory management, and input/output functions. Two such functions are invoked by the program in figure 9.1, effecting the “Hello world” printout. The program also demonstrates the three comment formats supported by Jack.\n\n\n  Figure 9.1 Hello World.\n9.1.2 Example 2: Procedural Programming and Array Handling\n  Jack is equipped with typical language constructs for procedural programming. It also includes basic commands for declaring and manipulating arrays. Figure 9.2 illustrates both of these features, in the context of inputting and computing the average of a series of numbers.\n  Jack programs declare and construct arrays using the built-in Array class, which is part of the standard Jack library. Note that Jack arrays are not typed and can include anything—integers, objects, and so forth.\n\n\n  Figure 9.2 Procedural programming and array handling.\n9.1.3 Example 3: Abstract Data Types\n  Every programming language has a fixed set of primitive data types, of which Jack supports three: int, char, and boolean. Programmers can extend this basic repertoire by creating new classes that represent abstract data types, as needed. For example, suppose we wish to endow Jack with the ability to handle rational numbers, namely, objects of the form n/m where n and m are integers. This can be done by creating a stand-alone class, designed to provide a fraction abstraction for Jack programs. Let us call this class Fraction.\n  Defining a Class Interface A reasonable way to get started is to specify the set of properties and services expected from a fraction abstraction. One such Application Program Interface (API), is given in figure 9.3a.\n\n\n  Figure 9.3a Fraction class API.\n  In Jack, operations on the current object (referred to as this) are represented by methods, whereas class-level operations (equivalent to static methods in Java) are represented by functions. Operations that create new objects are called constructors.\n  Using Classes APIs mean different things to different people. If you are the programmer who has to implement the fraction class, you can view its API as a contract that must be implemented, one way or another. Alternatively, if you are a programmer who needs to use fractions in your work, you can view the API as a documentation of a fraction server, designed to generate fraction objects and supply fraction-related operations. Taking this latter view, consider the Jack code listed in figure 9.3b.\n  Figure 9.3b illustrates an important software engineering principle: Users of any given abstraction don’t have to know anything about its underlying implementation. Rather, they can be given access only to the abstraction’s interface, or class API, and then use it as a black box server of abstraction-related operations.\n\n\n  Figure 9.3b Using the Fraction abstraction.\n  Implementing the Class We now turn to the other player in our story—the programmer who has to actually implement the fraction abstraction. A possible Jack implementation is given in figure 9.3c.\n  Figure 9.3c illustrates the typical Jack program structure: classes, methods, constructors, and functions. It also demonstrates all the statement types available in the language: let, do, if, while, and return.\n\n\n  Figure 9.3c A possible Fraction class implementation.\n\n\n\n\n9.1.4 Example 4: Linked List Implementation\n  A linked list (or simply list) is a chain of objects, each consisting of a data element and a reference (pointer) to the rest of the list. Figure 9.4 shows a possible Jack class implementation of the linked list abstraction. The purpose of this example is to illustrate typical object handling in the Jack language.\n\n\n  Figure 9.4 Object handling in a linked list context.\n"},"chapter09/02-The_Jack_Language_Specification.html":{"url":"chapter09/02-The_Jack_Language_Specification.html","title":"2.The Jack Language Specification","keywords":"","body":"9.2 The Jack Language Specification\n\n  We now turn to a formal and complete description of the Jack language, organized by its syntactic elements, program structure, variables, expressions, and statements. This language specification should be viewed as a technical reference, to be consulted as needed.\n9.2.1 Syntactic Elements\n  A Jack program is a sequence of tokens separated by an arbitrary amount of white space and comments, which are ignored. Tokens can be symbols, reserved words, constants, and identifiers, as listed in figure 9.5.\n\n\n  Figure 9.5 Jack syntactic elements.\n9.2.2 Program Structure\n  The basic programming unit in Jack is a class. Each class resides in a separate file and can be compiled separately. Class declarations have the following format:\n\n\n  Each class declaration specifies a name through which the class can be globally accessed. Next comes a sequence of zero or more field and static variable declarations. Then comes a sequence of one or more subroutine declarations, each defining a method, a function, or a constructor. Methods “belong to” objects and provide their functionality, while functions “belong to” the class in general and are not associated with a particular object (similar to Java’s static methods). A constructor “belongs to” the class and, when called, generates object instances of this class.\n  All subroutine declarations have the following format:\n\n\n  where subroutine is either constructor, method, or function. Each subroutine has a name through which it can be accessed, and a type describing the value returned by the subroutine. If the subroutine returns no value, the type is declared void; otherwise, it can be any of the primitive data types supported by the language, or any of the class types supplied by the standard library, or any of the class types supplied by other classes in the application. Constructors may have arbitrary names, but they must return an object of the class type. Therefore the type of a constructor must always be the name of the class to which it belongs.\n  Following its header specification, the subroutine declaration contains a sequence of zero or more local variable declarations, then a sequence of zero or more statements.\n  As in Java, a Jack program is a collection of one or more classes. One class must be named Main, and this class must include at least one function named main. When instructed to execute a Jack program that resides in some directory, the Jack run-time environment will automatically start running the Main.main function.\n9.2.3 Variables\n  Variables in Jack must be explicitly declared before they are used. There are four kinds of variables: field, static, local, and parameter variables, each with its associated scope. Variables must be typed.\n  Data Types Each variable can assume either a primitive data type (int, char, boolean), as predefined in the Jack language specification, or an object type, which is the name of a class. The class that implements this type can be either part of the Jack standard library (e.g., String or Array), or it may be any other class residing in the program directory.\n  Primitive Types Jack features three primitive data types:\n    • int: 16-bit 2’s complement\n    • boolean: false and true\n    • char: unicode character\n  Variables of primitive types are allocated to memory when they are declared. For example, the declarations var int age; var boolean gender; cause the compiler to create the variables age and gender and to allocate memory space to them.\n  Object Types Every class defines an object type. As in Java, the declaration of an object variable only causes the creation of a reference variable (pointer). Memory for storing the object itself is allocated later, if and when the programmer actually constructs the object by calling a constructor. Figure 9.6 gives an example.\n\n\n  Figure 9.6 Object types (example).\n  The Jack standard library provides two built-in object types (classes) that play a role in the language syntax: Array and String.\n  Arrays Arrays are declared using a built-in class called Array. Arrays are one-dimensional and the first index is always 0 (multi-dimensional arrays may be obtained as arrays of arrays). Array entries do not have a declared type, and different entries in the same array may have different types. The declaration of an array only creates a reference, while the actual construction of the array is done by calling the Array.new(length) constructor. Access to array elements is done using the a [j] notation. Figure 9.2 illustrates working with arrays.\n  Strings Strings are declared using a built-in class called String. The Jack compiler recognizes the syntax “xxx” and treats it as the contents of some String object. The contents of String objects can be accessed and modified using the methods of the String class, as documented in its API. Example:\n\n\n  Type Conversions The Jack language is weakly typed. The language specification does not define the results of attempted assignment or conversion from one type to another, and different Jack compilers may allow or forbid them. (This under-specification is intentional, allowing the construction of minimal Jack compilers that ignore typing issues.)\n  Having said that, all Jack compilers are expected to allow, and automatically perform, the following assignments:\n  ■ Characters and integers are automatically converted into each other as needed, according to the Unicode specification. Example:\n\n\n  ■ An integer can be assigned to a reference variable (of any object type), in which case it is treated as an address in memory. Example:\n\n\n  ■ An object variable (whose type is a class name) may be converted into an Array variable, and vice versa. The conversion allows accessing the object fields as array entries, and vice versa. Example:\n\n\n  Variable Kinds and Scope Jack features four kinds of variables. Static variables are defined at the class level and are shared by all the objects derived from the class. For example, a BankAccount class may have a totalBalance static variable holding the sum of balances of all the bank accounts, each account being an object derived from the BankAccount class. Field variables are used to define the properties of individual objects of the class, for example, account owner and balance. Local variables, used by subroutines, exist only as long as the subroutine is running, and parameter variables are used to pass arguments to subroutines. For example, our BankAccount class may include the method signature method void transfer(BankAccount from, int sum), declaring the two parameters from and sum. Thus, if joeAccount and janeAccount were two variables of type BankAccount, the command joeAccount.transfer(janeAccount, 100) will effect a transfer of 100 from Jane to Joe.\n  Figure 9.7 Variable kinds in the Jack language (throughout the table, subroutine is either a function, a method, or a constructor).\n\n\n  Figure 9.7 gives a formal description of all the variable kinds supported by the Jack language. The scope of a variable is the region in the program in which the variable name is recognized.\n9.2.4 Statements\n  The Jack language features five generic statements. They are defined and described in figure 9.8.\n\n\n  Figure 9.8 Jack statements.\n9.2.5 Expressions\n  Jack expressions are defined recursively according to the rules given in figure 9.9.\n\n\n  Figure 9.9 Jack expressions.\n  Operator Priority and Order of Evaluation Operator priority is not defined by the language, except that expressions in parentheses are evaluated first. Thus an expression like 2+3*4 may yield either 20 or 14, whereas 2+(3*4) is guaranteed to yield 14. The need to use parentheses in such expressions makes Jack programming a bit cumbersome. However, the lack of formal operator priority is intentional, since it simplifies the writing of Jack compilers. Of course, different language implementations (compilers) can specify an operator priority and add it to the language documentation, if so desired.\n9.2.6 Subroutine Calls\n  Subroutine calls invoke methods, functions, and constructors for their effect, using the general syntax subroutineName(argument-list). The number and type of the arguments must match those of the subroutine’s parameters, as defined in its declaration. The parentheses must appear even if the argument list is empty. Each argument may be an expression of unlimited complexity. For example, the Math class, which is part of Jack’s standard library, contains a square root function whose declaration is function int sqrt(int n). Such a function can be invoked using calls like Math.sqrt (17), or Math.sqrt ((a * Math.sqrt (c- 17) + 3), and so on.\n\n\n  Figure 9.10 Subroutine call examples.\n  Within a class, methods are called using the syntax methodName(argument-list), while functions and constructors must be called using their full names, namely, className.subroutineName(argument-list). Outside a class, the class functions and constructors are also called using their full names, while methods are called using the syntax varName.methodName(argument-list), where varName is a previously defined object variable. Figure 9.10 gives some examples.\n  Object Construction and Disposal Object construction is a two-stage affair. When a program declares a variable of some object type, only a reference (pointer) variable is created and allocated memory. To complete the object’s construction (if so desired), the program must call a constructor from the object’s class. Thus, a class that implements a type (e.g., Fraction from figure 9.3c) must contain at least one constructor. Constructors may have arbitrary names, but it is customary to call one of them new. Constructors are called just like any other class function using the format:\n  let varName = className.constructorName(parameter-list);\n  For example, let c = Circle.new(x,y,50) where x, y, and 50 are the screen location of the circle’s center and its radius. When a constructor is called, the compiler requests the operating system to allocate enough memory space to hold the new object in memory. The OS returns the base address of the allocated memory segment, and the compiler assigns it to this (in the circle example, the value of this is assigned to c). Next, the constructed object is typically initialized to some valid state, effected by the Jack commands found in the constructor’s body.\n  When an object is no longer needed in a program, it can be disposed. In particular, objects can be deallocated from memory and their space reclaimed using the Memory.deAlloc (object) function from the standard library. Convention calls for every class to contain a dispose() method that properly encapsulates this de-allocation. For example, see figure 9.4.\n9.2.7 The Jack Standard Library\n  The Jack language comes with a collection of built-in classes that extend the language’s capabilities. This standard library, which can also be viewed as a basic operating system, must be provided in every Jack language implementation.

In the next two chapters we will develop a Jack compiler that ultimately generates binary Hack code, and thus it is natural to discuss Jack applications in the Hack context. This section illustrates briefly three such applications and provides general guidelines about application development on the Jack-Hack platform.\n  Examples Four sample applications are illustrated in figure 9.11. The Pong game, whose Jack code is supplied with the book, provides a good illustration of Jack programming over the Hack platform. The Pong code is not trivial, requiring several hundred lines of Jack code organized in several classes. Further, the program has to carry out some nontrivial mathematical calculations in order to compute the direction of the ball’s movements. The program must also animate the movement of graphical objects on the screen, requiring extensive use of the language’s graphics drawing services. And, in order to do all of the above quickly, the program must be efficient, meaning that it has to do as few real-time calculations and screen drawing operations as possible.\n\n\n  Figure 9.11 Screen shots of sample Jack applications, running on the Hack computer. Hangman, Maze, Pong, and a simple data processing program.\n  Application Design and Implementation The development of Jack applications over a hardware platform like Hack requires careful planning (as always). First, the application designer must consider the physical limitations of the hardware, and plan accordingly. For example, the dimensions of the computer’s screen limit the size of the graphical images that the program can handle. Likewise, one must consider the language’s range of input/output commands and the platform’s execution speed, to gain a realistic expectation of what can and cannot be done.\n  As usual, the design process normally starts with a conceptual description of the application’s behavior. In the case of graphical and interactive programs, this may take the form of hand-written drawings of typical screens. In simple applications, one can proceed to implementation using procedural programming. In more complex tasks, it is advisable to first create an object-based design of the application. This entails the identification of classes, fields, and subroutines, possibly leading to the creation of some API document (e.g., figure 9.3a).\n  Next, one can proceed to implement the design in Jack and compile the class files using a Jack compiler. The testing and debugging of the code generated by the compiler depend on the details of the target platform. In the Hack platform supplied with the book, testing and debugging are normally done using the supplied VM emulator. Alternatively, one can translate the Jack program all the way to binary code and run it directly on the Hack hardware, or on the CPU emulator supplied with the book.\n  The Jack OS Jack programs make an extensive use of the various abstractions and services supplied by the language’s standard library, also called the Jack OS. This OS is itself implemented in Jack, and thus its executable version is a set of compiled .vm files—just like the user program (following compilation). Therefore, before running any Jack program, you must first copy into the program directory the .vm files comprising the Jack OS (supplied with the book). The chain of command is as follows: The computer is programmed to first run the Sys.init. This OS function, in turn, is programmed to start running your Main.main function. This function will then call various subroutines from both the user program and from the OS, and so on.\n  Although the standard library of the Jack language can be extended, readers will perhaps want to hone their programming skills elsewhere. After all, we don’t expect Jack to be part of your life beyond this book. Therefore, it is best to view the Jack/ Hack platform as a given environment and make the best out of it. That’s precisely what programmers do when they write software for embedded devices and dedicated processors that operate in restricted environments. Instead of viewing the constrains imposed by the host platform as a problem, professionals view it as an opportunity to display their resourcefulness and ingenuity. That’s why some of the best programmers in the trade were first trained on primitive computers.\n"},"chapter09/04-Perspective.html":{"url":"chapter09/04-Perspective.html","title":"4.Perspective","keywords":"","body":"9.4 Perspective\n\n  Jack is an “object-based” language, meaning that it supports objects and classes, but not inheritance. In this respect it is located somewhere between procedural languages like Pascal or C and object-oriented languages like Java or C++. Jack is certainly more “clunky” than any of these industrial-strength programming languages. However, its basic syntax and semantics are not very different from those of modern languages.\n  Some features of the Jack language leave much to be desired. For example, its primitive type system is, well, rather primitive. Moreover, it is a weakly typed language, meaning that type conformity in assignments and operations is not strictly enforced. Also, one may wonder why the Jack syntax includes keywords like do and let, why curly brackets must be used even in single statement blocks, and why the language does not enforce a formal operator priority.\n  Well, all these deviations from normal programming languages were introduced into Jack with one purpose: to allow the development of elegant and simple Jack compilers, as we will do in the next two chapters. For example, when parsing a statement (in any language), it is much easier to handle the code if the first token of the statement indicates which statement we’re in. That’s why the Jack syntax includes the do and let keywords, and so on. Thus, although Jack’s simplicity may be a nuisance when writing a Jack application, you will probably be quite grateful for it while writing the Jack compiler in the next two chapters.\n  Most modern languages are deployed with standard libraries, and so is Jack. As in Java and C#, this library can also be viewed as an interface to a simple and portable operating system. In the Jack-Hack platform, the services supplied by this OS are extremely minimal. They include no concurrency to support multi-threading or multi-processing, no file system to support permanent storage, and no communication. At the same time, the Jack OS provides some classical OS services like graphic and textual I/O (in very basic forms), standard implementation of strings, and standard memory allocation and de-allocation. Additionally, the Jack OS implements various mathematical functions, including multiplication and division, normally implemented in hardware. We return to these issues in chapter 12, where we will build this simple operating system as the last module in our computer system.\n"},"chapter09/05-Project.html":{"url":"chapter09/05-Project.html","title":"5.Project","keywords":"","body":"9.5 Project\n\n  Objective The hidden agenda of this project is to get acquainted with the Jack language, for two purposes: writing the Jack compiler in Projects 10 and 11, and writing the Jack operating system in Project 12.\n  Resources You will need three tools: the Jack compiler, to translate your program into a set of .vm files, the VM emulator, to run and test your translated program, and the Jack Operating System.\n  Contract Adopt or invent an application idea, for example, a simple computer game or some other interactive program. Then design and build the application.\n  The Jack OS The Jack Operating System is available as a set of .vm files. These files constitute an implementation of the standard library of the Jack programming language. In order for any Jack program to execute properly, the compiled .vm files of the program must reside in a directory that also contains all the .vm files of the Jack OS. When an OS-oriented error is detected by the Jack OS, it displays a numeric error code (rather than text, which wastes precious memory space). A list of all the currently supported error codes and their textual descriptions can be found in the file projects/09/OSerrors.txt.\n  Compiling and Running a Jack Program\n  0. Each program must be stored in a separate directory, say Xxx. Start by creating this directory, then copy all the files from tools/OS into it.\n  1. Write your Jack program—a set of one or more Jack classes—each stored in a separate ClassName.jack text file. Put all these .jack files in the Xxx directory.\n  2. Compile your program using the supplied Jack compiler. This is best done by applying the compiler to the name of the program directory (Xxx). This will cause the compiler to translate all the .jack classes found in the directory into corresponding .vm files. If a compilation error is reported, debug the program and recompile Xxx until no error messages are issued.\n  3. At this point the program directory should contain three sets of files: (i) your source .jack files, (ii) the compiled .vm files, one for each of your .jack class files, and (iii) additional .vm files, comprising the supplied Jack OS. To test the compiled program, invoke the VM emulator and load the entire Xxx program directory. Then run the program. In case of run-time errors or undesired program behavior, fix the program and go to stage 2.\n  A Sample Jack Program The book’s software suite includes a complete example of a Jack application, stored in projects/09/Square. This directory contains the source Jack code of three classes comprising a simple interactive game.\n"},"chapter10/00-Compiler_I_Syntax_Analysis.html":{"url":"chapter10/00-Compiler_I_Syntax_Analysis.html","title":"10.

S. Eliot (1888-1965)\n\n\n  Congratulations! You have finished the construction of a complete computing system. We hope that you enjoyed this journey. Let us, the authors of this book, share a secret with you: We suspect that we enjoyed writing the book even more. After all, we got to design this computing system, and design is often the “funnest” part of every project. We are sure that some of you, adventurous readers, would like to get in on some of that design action. Maybe you would like to improve the architecture; maybe you have ideas for adding new features here and there; maybe you envision a wider system. And then, maybe, you just want to be in the navigator’s seat and decide where to go, not only how to get there.\n  Many alternative design elements can be implemented by modifying and extending the software that you have written in the various projects. For example, the assembly language, the Jack language, and the operating system can be modified and extended at will, by changing their specifications and rewriting portions of your respective assembler, compiler, and OS implementations. Other changes would likely require modification of the software supplied by us. For example, if you change the VM specification or the hardware specification, then you would probably want to change the respective emulators as well. Or if you want to add a new input or output device to the Hack computer, you would probably need to model them as built-in chips in the hardware simulator.\n  In order to allow complete flexibility of modifications and extensions, we are making all the source code of the software associated with the book publicly available. All our code is 100 percent Java, expect for the batch files used for starting the software on the Windows and Linux platforms. The software and its documentation are available from the book’s Web site at http://www.idc.ac.il/tecs. You are welcome to modify and extend all our tools as you deem desirable for your latest idea—and then share them with others, if you want. We hope that our code is written and documented well enough to make modification a satisfying experience. In particular, we wish to mention that the supplied hardware simulator has a simple and well-documented interface for adding new “built-in” chips. This interface can be used for extending the simulated hardware platform with, say, disk storage or communications devices.\n  While we cannot even start to imagine what your design improvements may be, we can briefly sketch some of the ones we were thinking of.\n"},"chapter13/01-Hardware_Realizations.html":{"url":"chapter13/01-Hardware_Realizations.html","title":"1.Hardware Realizations","keywords":"","body":"13.1 Hardware Realizations\n\n  Every hardware module presented in the book was software-based and HDLSIMULATED. This, in fact, is how hardware is actually designed. However, at some point the HDL designs are committed to silicon, becoming “real computers.” Wouldn’t it be nice to make Hack or Jack also run on some “real platform,” made from some “real stuff”? Several different approaches may be taken towards this goal. On one extreme, you can attempt to nearly directly fabricate a real chip using the existing HDL design of Hack, and then deal with implementation issues related to the RAM, ROM, and I/O devices. Another extreme approach may be to attempt emulation (of either Hack, the VM, or even the Jack platform) on some existing hardware device like a cell phone or a PDA. It seems that any such project would want to reduce the size of the Hack screen as to keep the cost of the hardware resources reasonable.\n"},"chapter13/02-Hardware_Improvements.html":{"url":"chapter13/02-Hardware_Improvements.html","title":"2.Hardware Improvements","keywords":"","body":"13.2 Hardware Improvements\n\n  Although Hack is a stored program computer, the program that it runs must be prestored in its ROM device. In the present Hack architecture, there is no way of loading another program into the computer under user control, except for simulating the replacement of the entire physical ROM chip. Adding a “load program” capability in a balanced way would likely involve changes at several levels of the hierarchy. The Hack hardware can be modified to allow loaded programs to reside in a writable RAM rather than in the existing ROM. Some type of permanent storage (e.g., a disk-on-chip) can probably be added to the hardware, to allow storage of programs. The operating system can be extended to handle this permanent storage device, as well as new logic for loading and running programs. At this point some kind of an OS user interface (“shell” or “DOS window”) would come in handy.\n"},"chapter13/03-High-Level_Languages.html":{"url":"chapter13/03-High-Level_Languages.html","title":"3.High-Level Languages","keywords":"","body":"13.3 High-Level Languages\n\n  Like all professionals, programmers have strong feelings about their tools—the programming languages they use—and like to personalize them.
