### 13.4 Optimizations

&emsp;&emsp;The book has almost completely sidestepped optimization issues (except for chapter 12, which introduced some efficiency measures). Optimization is a great playfield for every hacker. You can start with local optimizations in the existing compiler or hardware (or, in our platform, the best bang for the buck will probably come from optimizing the VM translator). Ambitious optimizations on a more global scale will involve changing specifications of interfaces such as the machine language or the VM language.
