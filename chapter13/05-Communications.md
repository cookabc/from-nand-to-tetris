### 13.5 Communications
---



&emsp;&emsp;Wouldn’t it be nice to connect the Hack computer to the Internet? This could probably be done by adding a built-in communication chip to the hardware and writing some OS code to deal with it and to handle higher-level communication protocols. Some other programs would need to “talk” with the simulated communication chip, providing an interface to the Internet. For example, an HTTP-speaking Web browser in Jack seems like a feasible and worthy project.

&emsp;&emsp;These are some of our design itches—what are yours?
